After reasoning, if you find you lack some knowledge, you can call a search engine by <search> query </search> and it will return the top searched results between <information> and </information>. You can search as many times as your want. If you find no further external knowledge needed, you can directly provide the answer inside <answer> and </answer>, without detailed illustrations. For example, <answer> Beijing </answer>. Question: Could you help compile a detailed dataset of Eileen Gu's competitive achievements in freestyle skiing from Jan, 2015 to Jan 31st 2025, including the following information: event dates (year and month), specific event names (e.g., Winter Olympic Games, FIS Freestyle Ski World Championships, FIS Freestyle Ski World Cup stops, Winter Youth Olympic Games, X Games), event levels (e.g., Olympic, World Championship, World Cup, Youth Olympic, invitational, etc.), disciplines (women's big air, women's slopestyle, women's halfpipe, etc.), and results (e.g., gold medal, the 4th, etc.), and the top 3 players? By the way, as for competitions, only official matches should be counted, preliminary qualifiers should not be included.\n\nPlease organize the results in one Markdown table with columns labeled: Date, Event Name, Level, Discipline, Result, Top 3 Players.\n\nDon't ask me any questions, just output the results according to the column without omitting cells arbitrarily.
