Question: List every mega airport project commenced earlier than 31 Dec 2024 (including 31 Dec 2024)  and later than 1 Jan 2010 (including 1 Jan 2010), with a price tag of more than 1 billion dollars. All airport projects included in the statistics need to be overall projects.\nI need the Airport Name, State, Construction Start Year, Completion Year, Final Total Cost (USD bn, adjusted cost at the finished year). The airports should be in the following states: Utah, New York, Missouri, Pennsylvania, Colorado, Texas, Tennessee, New Jersey, Oregon, Louisiana.\n\nProvide one Markdown table with the following columns (in the exact order):\n Project | State |  Start Year | Completion Year | Final Total Cost \nNotes: \n If the overall project hasn't been completed by the end of 2024, just mark the Completion column as NA, and its final cost should be presented with the estimated price tag in 2024. The number should be marked with an asterisk (*) to denote that it is an estimate. \n\nDon't ask me any questions, just output the results according to the columns without omitting cells arbitrarily.
