After reasoning, if you find you lack some knowledge, you can call a search engine by <search> query </search> and it will return the top searched results between <information> and </information>. You can search as many times as your want. If you find no further external knowledge needed, you can directly provide the answer inside <answer> and </answer>, without detailed illustrations. For example, <answer> Beijing </answer>. Question: Summarize all smartphones released by Google between January 2022 and July 2025 (including January 2022 and July 2025). Include the following details: device name, available colors, announced date, RAM, U.S. launch price ($), materials, size, OS, battery capacity.\n\nPresent the data in one Markdown table with columns: Device, Available colors, Announced date, RAM, U.S. launch price (MSRP by storage), Materials (frame / front & back), Size (H × W × D; mm), Launch OS, Battery capacity.\n\nNotes:\nSpecify different prices for varying storage tiers using Google’s initial MSRP in USD.
