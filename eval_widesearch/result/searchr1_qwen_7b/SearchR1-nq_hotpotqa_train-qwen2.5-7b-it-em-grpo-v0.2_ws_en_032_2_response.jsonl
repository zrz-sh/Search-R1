I wanna know each Sydney train's line number, line name, total number of stations, and termini. Pay attention: each Sydney railway line, that has been put into use by May 31, 2025, is included. The total number of stations should reflect the status quo in Sydney as of May 2025. \n\nPlease organize the results in one Markdown table with the following columns:\nLine Number, Line Name, Total Stations, Termini\nNote: When compiling the total number of stations, variations in station count resulting from peak-hour additions or reductions are excluded.\n\nDon't ask me any questions, just output the results according to the columns without omitting cells arbitrarily.
