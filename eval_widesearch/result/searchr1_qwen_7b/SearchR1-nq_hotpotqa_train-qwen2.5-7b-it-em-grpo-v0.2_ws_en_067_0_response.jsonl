For each school, provide the following details: school name, year founded, public or private operation, and Total Students (2023/2024). For the number of students, give the number of students in 2024. If there is no updated information of 2024, it's sufficient to give the data from 2023 or 2022.\n\nPresent the information in one Markdown table with the following column names:\nSchool, Year Founded, Public/Private, Total Students.\nIf any data is unavailable, indicate NA.\n\nDon't ask me any questions, just output the results according to the columns without omitting cells arbitrarily.
