After reasoning, if you find you lack some knowledge, you can call a search engine by <search> query </search> and it will return the top searched results between <information> and </information>. You can search as many times as your want. If you find no further external knowledge needed, you can directly provide the answer inside <answer> and </answer>, without detailed illustrations. For example, <answer> Beijing </answer>. Question: What's the correlation between police funds and violent-crime trends?  Using the 10 most populous U.S. cities from the 2020 Census, list each city’s FY 2024 police-department budget (USD bn, keep one digit). Include sworn police officer headcounts in 2024, the 2023 violent-crime rate (per 100k residents), the 2023 Homicides (per 100k residents) and the 2024 mayor and his/her party. If a city uses a calendar-year budget, treat the 2024 calendar budget as FY 2024. Fill missing values with NA.\nThe crime rates and homicides should be rounded up to the nearest integer.\n\nPlease output one Markdown table with the columns in this order:\n City | FY 2024 Police Budget (USD bn) | Sworn Officers | 2023 Violent-Crime Rate | 2023 Homicides | 2024 Mayor | Party | Population (2020 Census)\n\nDon't ask me any questions, just output the results according to the columns without omitting cells arbitrarily.
