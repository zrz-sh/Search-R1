Question: Please help me sort out a list of NVIDIA's desktop graphics card products released from 1990 to 2024 (including 1990 and 2024), including the specific product series, product names, chip names, release dates, bus interfaces, memory capacities, memory types, memory bit widths, core frequencies (base frequencies), and memory frequencies.\n\nPlease output the sorted data in the format of one Markdown table. The column names in the table are: Product Series, Product Name, Chip Name, Release Date, Bus Interface, Memory Capacity, Memory Type, Memory Bit Width, Core Frequency, Memory Frequency.\nRelease Date should be formatted as Sep 12th, 2012. If the same graphics card product is based on multiple chips (graphics processor), list each chips in a row.\nchips\n\nDon't ask me any questions, just output the results according to the column without omitting cells arbitrarily.
