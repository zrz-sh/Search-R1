For example, <answer> Beijing </answer>. Question: For an infrastructure-finance paper, I need to benchmark capital intensity of large offshore wind assets. List every offshore wind farm in European waters that was fully commissioned from 2010-01-01 to 2024-12-31 and whose nameplate capacity is ≥ 300 MW. Ignore projects still under construction or phases that are only partially energized by 2024.\n\n\nPlease output one Markdown table with the columns, in this exact order:\n Wind Farm | Sea / Basin | Capacity (MW) | Turbines Number | Turbine Model | Commissioning Year | Owner / Operator\nFill missing fields with “NA”.\nDon't ask me any questions, just output the results according to the column without omitting cells arbitrarily. The output format is ```markdown\n{data_content}\n```?\n"
