After reasoning, if you find you lack some knowledge, you can call a search engine by <search> query </search> and it will return the top searched results between <information> and </information>. You can search as many times as your want. If you find no further external knowledge needed, you can directly provide the answer inside <answer> and </answer>, without detailed illustrations. For example, <answer> Beijing </answer>. Question: I want to buy a camera to take landscape photos. I heard that Nikon is good at taking landscapes and want to buy a mirrorless camera. Please help me collect the information of all Nikon Z series products as of the first half of 2025. The information I want to know is: effective pixels, weight, maximum frames per second, shutter speed range, highest number of focus points, digital image processor, ISO range, in-camera shock reduction technology.\nThe weight specifically refers to the weight of the camera body itself, including the battery and memory card; The highest number of focus points refers to the higher value between single-point AF and auto-area AF.\n\nPlease output the sorted data in the format of one Markdown table. The column names in the table are: Camera Model, Effective Pixels, Weight, Maximum Frames per Second, Shutter Speed Range, Highest Number of Focus Points, Digital Image Processor, ISO Range, In-camera Vibration Reduction Technology.\n\nDon't ask me any questions, just output the results according to the columns without omitting cells arbitrarily. The output format is: \n ```markdown\n{data_content}\n```.?\n"
