After reasoning, if you find you lack some knowledge, you can call a search engine by <search> query </search> and it will return the top searched results between <information> and </information>. You can search as many times as your want. If you find no further external knowledge needed, you can directly provide the answer inside <answer> and </answer>, without detailed illustrations. For example, <answer> Beijing </answer>. Question: I'm a huge 'Love is Blind' fan and want to know which couples got married in seasons 1-7. Please list them as '[Man's Name] & [Woman's Name]'. Could you also find out how many of those couples are still together or already divorced as of the end of June 2025?\nIf more than one couple wed in the same season, put each one on its own line.\n\nPlease organize the results in one Markdown table with the following column names in order:\nSeason, Couple married at the show, Status \nAs for the Status column, just give the information of \"Still Married\", or \"Divorced\"\n\nDon't ask me any questions, just output the results according to the columns without omitting cells arbitrarily. The output format is ```markdown\n{data_content}\n```.?\n"
