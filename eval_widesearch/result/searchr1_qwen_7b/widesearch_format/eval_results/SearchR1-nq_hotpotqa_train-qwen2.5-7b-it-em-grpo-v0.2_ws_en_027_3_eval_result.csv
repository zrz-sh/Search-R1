,,charlesdickensmuseum,Charles Dickens Museum,0.0,"Let's analyze the given pair according to the provided grading criterion.

Standard answer (target): ""48doughtystreet,londonwc1n2lx""  
Response: ""48doughtystreet,londonwc1n2da""

Step-by-step analysis:  
- Both addresses have the same street name: ""48doughtystreet""  
- Both have ""london"" included  
- The postal code parts differ in the last two characters: target ""n2lx"" vs response ""n2da""  
- The difference is only in the last two characters of the postcode, which changes the exact location  
- According to the criterion: It is sufficient if the semantics are approximately the same or if they point to the same entity; no need for exact wording. However, the postal code is quite specific and different, possibly pointing to a different location in London.  
- This could be considered a different exact address because postcode suffixes generally denote different small geographic areas or buildings. So the addresses are not pointing to the exact same entity.  
- Therefore, this is not approximately the same in a way that would be considered correct or acceptable per the criterion.

Hence, assign score 0.
