### idx_0  
- Response: ""2364fultonst,fresno,ca93728""  
- Target: ""650n.fultonstreet,fresno,ca93728""

Analysis:  
- Both addresses are on ""Fulton Street"" in Fresno, CA with the same zip code 93728.  
- The street number is different: 2364 vs. 650n.  
- The city and zip code match perfectly.  
- The criterion says semantics or same entity is sufficient. However, the street number difference means they are different locations on the same street. They are not the same entity or exact address.  
- Since the street number is different, the semantics don't line up as ""the same address.""  
- Given that the address numbers differ significantly, this is not the same entity (house or building).  
- Therefore, this should be scored 0.

### idx_1  
- Response: ""1055nfresnost,fresno,ca93721""  
- Target: ""165northclarkstreet,fresno,ca93701""

Analysis:  
- The response includes ""1055 N Fresno St"" (reading it as ""1055 n fresnost"") in Fresno, 93721.  
- The target is ""165 North Clark Street,"" Fresno, 93701.  
- Both addresses are different streets (Fresno St vs Clark St) and different numbers (1055 vs 165).  
- Zip codes differ: 93721 vs 93701, indicating different locations within Fresno.  
- These are clearly different addresses/entities.  
- The criterion requires approximately the same semantics or pointing to the same entity. Here, the addresses differ significantly.  
- Score: 0.

**Pair idx_0**

- **Response:** ""notspecified""
- **Target:** ""8am-4:30pm""

Analysis: The target specifies an exact time range 8am-4:30pm. The response states ""notspecified"" which means no information about the time. This does not point to the same entity or give the same semantic meaning.

**Conclusion:** Score = 0

**Pair idx_1**

- **Response:** ""notspecified""
- **Target:** ""closed""

Analysis: Target is ""closed"" indicating status. Response is ""notspecified,"" meaning no information. These do not point to the same entity or have approximately the same semantics.
