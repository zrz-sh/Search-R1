- idx_0:
  - Reference answer (target): ""2014""
  - Response: ""2014""

According to the criterion, the semantics need to be approximately the same or point to the same entity. Here both the target and the response are identical (""2014"").

The response exactly matches the target answer, so the score should be full, which is 1.

```json

    ""idx_0"": 1

```
",2014,2014,1.0,"Analysis:

- Standard answer (target) for idx_0: ""utah""
- Response for idx_0: ""utah""

According to the grading criterion, the semantics must be approximately the same or point to the same entity. Here, the response exactly matches the target answer.

Therefore, the score is 1.

Final scoring results:
