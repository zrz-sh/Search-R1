**idx_0**  
- Response: 朴成奂  
- Target: 李东根  
- Criterion: The response should have the same or roughly the same meaning or refer to the same entity.  
- Analysis: 朴成奂 and 李东根 are two different names/persons. Unless these names are known aliases of the same person (there is no indication here), they do not match or refer to the same entity. Therefore, score = 0.

**idx_1**  
- Response: 吕家正  
- Target: 常山干太  
- Analysis: 吕家正 and 常山干太 are different names/entities, so they do not match or have the same meaning. Score = 0.

**idx_2**  
- Response: /  
- Target: /  
- Analysis: Both response and target are the same symbol ""/"". The criterion says they can be roughly the same. They are exactly the same here. Score = 1.

---

### idx_0
- Response: ""21-15,21-16""  
- Target: ""19-21,21-14,21-14""  

Analysis:  
The response gives two scores, both in favor of the first party (21 for, 15 and 16 against), whereas the target is a three-set match with actual scores resulting in the first player losing the first set (19-21) and winning the next two (21-14, 21-14). The response and target do not indicate the same entities or meaning. They are different scores, sets, and number of sets.

Conclusion: They are not semantically equivalent.

Score: 0

---

### idx_1
- Response: ""21-16,21-19""  
- Target: ""19-21,21-14,21-7""  

Analysis:  
Response shows two sets with first party winning both (21-16 and 21-19), but target shows a three-set match with first party losing the first set (19-21), then winning the next two (21-14, 21-7). The response is missing a set and has different scores.

Conclusion: They do not represent the same meaning or entities.

Score: 0

---

### idx_2
- Response: ""/""  
- Target: ""/""  

Analysis:  
Both response and target are ""/"", which presumably means no data or not applicable. They are identical in meaning.

Conclusion: They match in entities and meaning.

   - Target: 坦农萨克
   - Analysis: The target and the response are different entities. According to the criterion, the response should be semantically similar or refer to the same entity. Here, 李宗伟 is a different person from 坦农萨克, so the answer is incorrect.
   - Score: 0

2. idx_1:
   - Response: 李宗伟
   - Target: /
   - Analysis: The target is ""/"". This likely means there is no reference answer provided (or it is a null or placeholder). The criterion states similarity or reference to the entity is needed; since the target is empty, it is ambiguous. However, as no answer is expected, the response is just a named entity. Since the criterion does not specify explicitly, the safest interpretation is that the response does not match or is not required.

**idx_0**  
- Response: ""21-19,17-21,21-18""  
- Target: ""21-18,21-11""  
Analysis:  
The response provides three game scores; the target provides two different game scores. The scores do not match, neither the number of games nor the results are consistent. The scores are different and thus they do not point to the same entity or meaning. Based on the criterion, this would be scored as 0.

---

**idx_1**  
- Response: ""21-19,21-15""  
- Target: ""/"" (meaning no target answer provided)  
Analysis:  
Since the target is ""/"", i.e., no correct answer is provided for comparison, we cannot judge the semantic similarity. But typically, if target is empty or missing, the response cannot be verified as correct or incorrect. Following standard grading practice, if a target answer is missing or ""/"", the score given should be 0 because there is no basis to claim the response is consistent with the target.

---

**idx_2**

     Since the criterion is about matching semantics or entities, and here target is empty,
     it is not possible to say they are correct or semantically same.

### Item idx_0
- Target: ""26-28,21-19,21-19""
- Response: ""21-19,21-18""
- Analysis:
  - The response includes two score strings ""21-19"" and ""21-18"".
  - The target includes three score strings: ""26-28"", ""21-19"", and ""21-19"".
  - The response partially overlaps with the target (""21-19""), but the rest differs (""21-18"" vs ""26-28"" and extra ""21-19"").
  - According to the criterion, the semantic or entity reference should be roughly the same or point to the same entities.
  - Here, the actual scores differ significantly: ""21-18"" is not same as ""26-28"" or ""21-19"", and also the number of scores differs.
  - This is not a roughly equivalent or consistent entity representation.
  - Therefore, score = 0

### Item idx_1
- Target: ""/""
- Response: ""21-19,21-13""
- Analysis:
  - Target is ""/""
  - Response gives concrete scores ""21-19,21-13""
  - The standard answer is essentially empty or no answer ("" / "" often means none/not available)
  - Response provides an answer where standard has none, so inconsistent.

### idx_0

- Response: `/`
- Target: `常山干太`

Analysis:  
Response gives `/` which presumably means no answer or an empty answer. Target is `常山干太` (Changshan Ganta, a person’s name). Since the response is empty and target is a proper noun, the response does not match or have the same semantic meaning as the target.

---

### idx_0:
- Response: ""21-19,21-15""  
- Target: ""21-12,21-11""  
- Analysis: Both represent two scores in a format commonly used in games/sports to indicate winning sets. They follow the same structure, but the actual numbers are different. Since the criterion requires the meanings to be roughly the same or referring to the same entity, but here the numbers are different — so the semantics differ because the scores are not the same or close. Unless the criterion considers ""roughly the same"" meaning including small score differences (which is unlikely for scores), they do not refer to the same final result.

**Conclusion:** Different scores, so score is 0.

---

### idx_1:
- Response: ""21-18,21-13""  
- Target: ""/""  
- Analysis: The target is ""/"", which likely means ""no answer"" or ""no data."" The response provides two scores. Since ""/"" means no reference answer, and the response provides some answer, do these match? The criterion says roughly the same meaning or same entity. Since the target is blank or null (""/""), the response cannot match the target.

**Conclusion:** Response provides a concrete score, while the target has none. Score is 0.

---

### idx_2:
- Response: ""/""  
- Target: ""3:2""  
- Analysis: Response provides no answer (""/""), target is ""3:2"" (likely sets or games won). Because no answer equivalent to target's valid score means no semantic match.

**Conclusion:** Score is 0.

Although ""首要超级赛"" could be interpreted as an important Super Series tournament, it does not precisely align with ""超级300"" or point to the same entity.

   - Response: ""世界羽毛球锦标赛"" (World Badminton Championships)  
   Analysis: The target is a specific tournament level (Super 1000), which is part of the BWF World Tour. The response is a different tournament, the World Badminton Championships, which is a separate event. These are not semantically equivalent and do not point to the same entity.

- Response: 朴成奂  
- Target: 李东根  
- Criterion: The response should have the same or roughly the same meaning or refer to the same entity.  
- Analysis: 朴成奂 and 李东根 are two different names/persons. Unless these names are known aliases of the same person (there is no indication here), they do not match or refer to the same entity. Therefore, score = 0.

### idx_0
- Response: ""21-15,21-16""  
- Target: ""19-21,21-14,21-14""  

Analysis:  
The response gives two scores, both in favor of the first party (21 for, 15 and 16 against), whereas the target is a three-set match with actual scores resulting in the first player losing the first set (19-21) and winning the next two (21-14, 21-14). The response and target do not indicate the same entities or meaning. They are different scores, sets, and number of sets.

Conclusion: They are not semantically equivalent.

Response shows two sets with first party winning both (21-16 and 21-19), but target shows a three-set match with first party losing the first set (19-21), then winning the next two (21-14, 21-7). The response is missing a set and has different scores.

Conclusion: They do not represent the same meaning or entities.

Score: 0

   - Analysis: The target is ""/"". This likely means there is no reference answer provided (or it is a null or placeholder). The criterion states similarity or reference to the entity is needed; since the target is empty, it is ambiguous. However, as no answer is expected, the response is just a named entity.

**idx_0**  
- Response: ""21-19,17-21,21-18""  
- Target: ""21-18,21-11""  
Analysis:  
The response provides three game scores; the target provides two different game scores. The scores do not match, neither the number of games nor the results are consistent. The scores are different and thus they do not point to the same entity or meaning. Based on the criterion, this would be scored as 0.

---

**idx_1**  
- Response: ""21-19,21-15""  
- Target: ""/"" (meaning no target answer provided)  
Analysis:  
Since the target is ""/"", i.e., no correct answer is provided for comparison, we cannot judge the semantic similarity. But typically, if target is empty or missing, the response cannot be verified as correct or incorrect. Following standard grading practice, if a target answer is missing or ""/"", the score given should be 0 because there is no basis to claim the response is consistent with the target.

### Item idx_0
- Target: ""26-28,21-19,21-19""
- Response: ""21-19,21-18""
- Analysis:
  - The response includes two score strings ""21-19"" and ""21-18"".
  - The target includes three score strings: ""26-28"", ""21-19"", and ""21-19"".
  - The response partially overlaps with the target (""21-19""), but the rest differs (""21-18"" vs ""26-28"" and extra ""21-19"").
  - According to the criterion, the semantic or entity reference should be roughly the same or point to the same entities.
  - Here, the actual scores differ significantly: ""21-18"" is not same as ""26-28"" or ""21-19"", and also the number of scores differs.
  - This is not a roughly equivalent or consistent entity representation.
  - Therefore, score = 0

### Item idx_1

- Response: `/`
- Target: `常山干太`

Analysis:  
Response gives `/` which presumably means no answer or an empty answer. Target is `常山干太` (Changshan Ganta, a person’s name). Since the response is empty and target is a proper noun, the response does not match or have the same semantic meaning as the target.

---

### idx_0:
- Response: ""21-19,21-15""  
- Target: ""21-12,21-11""  
- Analysis: Both represent two scores in a format commonly used in games/sports to indicate winning sets. They follow the same structure, but the actual numbers are different. Since the criterion requires the meanings to be roughly the same or referring to the same entity, but here the numbers are different — so the semantics differ because the scores are not the same or close. Unless the criterion considers ""roughly the same"" meaning including small score differences (which is unlikely for scores), they do not refer to the same final result.

**Conclusion:** Different scores, so score is 0.

---

### idx_1:
- Response: ""21-18,21-13""  
- Target: ""/""  
- Analysis: The target is ""/"", which likely means ""no answer"" or ""no data."" The response provides two scores. Since ""/"" means no reference answer, and the response provides some answer, do these match? The criterion says roughly the same meaning or same entity. Since the target is blank or null (""/""), the response cannot match the target.

**Conclusion:** Response provides a concrete score, while the target has none. Score is 0.

---

### idx_2:
- Response: ""/""  
- Target: ""3:2""  
- Analysis: Response provides no answer (""/""), target is ""3:2"" (likely sets or games won). Because no answer equivalent to target's valid score means no semantic match.

**Conclusion:** Score is 0.

### idx_0
- Response: ""21-15,21-16""  
- Target: ""19-21,21-14,21-14""  

Analysis:  
The response gives two scores, both in favor of the first party (21 for, 15 and 16 against), whereas the target is a three-set match with actual scores resulting in the first player losing the first set (19-21) and winning the next two (21-14, 21-14). The response and target do not indicate the same entities or meaning. They are different scores, sets, and number of sets.

Conclusion: They are not semantically equivalent.

Score: 0

---

### idx_1
- Response: ""21-16,21-19""  
- Target: ""19-21,21-14,21-7""  

Analysis:  
Response shows two sets with first party winning both (21-16 and 21-19), but target shows a three-set match with first party losing the first set (19-21), then winning the next two (21-14, 21-7). The response is missing a set and has different scores.

Conclusion: They do not represent the same meaning or entities.

Score: 0

---

### idx_2
- Response: ""/""  
- Target: ""/""  

Analysis:  
Both response and target are ""/"", which presumably means no data or not applicable. They are identical in meaning.

Conclusion: They match in entities and meaning.

Score: 1

2. idx_1:
   - Response: 李宗伟
   - Target: /
   - Analysis: The target is ""/"". This likely means there is no reference answer provided (or it is a null or placeholder). The criterion states similarity or reference to the entity is needed; since the target is empty, it is ambiguous. However, as no answer is expected, the response is just a named entity.

**idx_0**  
- Response: ""21-19,17-21,21-18""  
- Target: ""21-18,21-11""  
Analysis:  
The response provides three game scores; the target provides two different game scores. The scores do not match, neither the number of games nor the results are consistent. The scores are different and thus they do not point to the same entity or meaning. Based on the criterion, this would be scored as 0.

---

**idx_1**  
- Response: ""21-19,21-15""  
- Target: ""/"" (meaning no target answer provided)  
Analysis:  
Since the target is ""/"", i.e., no correct answer is provided for comparison, we cannot judge the semantic similarity. But typically, if target is empty or missing, the response cannot be verified as correct or incorrect. Following standard grading practice, if a target answer is missing or ""/"", the score given should be 0 because there is no basis to claim the response is consistent with the target.

### Item idx_0
- Target: ""26-28,21-19,21-19""
- Response: ""21-19,21-18""
- Analysis:
  - The response includes two score strings ""21-19"" and ""21-18"".
  - The target includes three score strings: ""26-28"", ""21-19"", and ""21-19"".
  - The response partially overlaps with the target (""21-19""), but the rest differs (""21-18"" vs ""26-28"" and extra ""21-19"").
  - According to the criterion, the semantic or entity reference should be roughly the same or point to the same entities.
  - Here, the actual scores differ significantly: ""21-18"" is not same as ""26-28"" or ""21-19"", and also the number of scores differs.
  - This is not a roughly equivalent or consistent entity representation.
  - Therefore, score = 0

### Item idx_1
- Target: ""/""
- Response: ""21-19,21-13""
- Analysis:
  - Target is ""/""
  - Response gives concrete scores ""21-19,21-13""
  - The standard answer is essentially empty or no answer ("" / "" often means none/not available)
  - Response provides an answer where standard has none, so inconsistent.

### idx_0

- Response: `/`
- Target: `常山干太`

Analysis:  
Response gives `/` which presumably means no answer or an empty answer. Target is `常山干太` (Changshan Ganta, a person’s name). Since the response is empty and target is a proper noun, the response does not match or have the same semantic meaning as the target.

---

### idx_0:
- Response: ""21-19,21-15""  
- Target: ""21-12,21-11""  
- Analysis: Both represent two scores in a format commonly used in games/sports to indicate winning sets. They follow the same structure, but the actual numbers are different. Since the criterion requires the meanings to be roughly the same or referring to the same entity, but here the numbers are different — so the semantics differ because the scores are not the same or close. Unless the criterion considers ""roughly the same"" meaning including small score differences (which is unlikely for scores), they do not refer to the same final result.

**Conclusion:** Different scores, so score is 0.

---

### idx_1:
- Response: ""21-18,21-13""  
- Target: ""/""  
- Analysis: The target is ""/"", which likely means ""no answer"" or ""no data."" The response provides two scores. Since ""/"" means no reference answer, and the response provides some answer, do these match? The criterion says roughly the same meaning or same entity. Since the target is blank or null (""/""), the response cannot match the target.

**Conclusion:** Response provides a concrete score, while the target has none. Score is 0.

---

### idx_2:
- Response: ""/""  
- Target: ""3:2""  
- Analysis: Response provides no answer (""/""), target is ""3:2"" (likely sets or games won). Because no answer equivalent to target's valid score means no semantic match.

**Conclusion:** Score is 0.
