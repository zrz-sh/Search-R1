**Criterion:**  
- It is sufficient if the semantics are approximately the same as the reference answer or if they point to the same entity.  
- No need for word-for-word correspondence.  

---

### idx_0  
- Response: ""kirstjennielsen""  
- Target: ""kristennielsen""  
Analysis: The response is very likely a misspelling of the target name ""Kristen Nielsen."" Given the criterion that approximate semantics or pointing to the same entity is sufficient, misspelling that does not cause confusion with another entity should receive a full score.  
Score: 1

---

### idx_1  
- Response: ""jimmattis""  
- Target: ""markesper""  
Analysis: The response and target clearly refer to different entities (Jimmy Mattis vs. Mark Esper). They do not point to the same person or entity, and the semantic meaning is different.
