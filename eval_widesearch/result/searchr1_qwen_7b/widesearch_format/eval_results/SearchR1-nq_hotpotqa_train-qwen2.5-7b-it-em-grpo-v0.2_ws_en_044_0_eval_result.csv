**idx_0**

- Response: ""198sejong-daero,jongno-gu,seoul""
- Target: ""37samcheong-ro,jongnodistrict,seoul""

Analysis:

- Both addresses are in the Jongno district area of Seoul.
- The road names differ (""sejong-daero"" vs ""samcheong-ro"").
- Street numbers differ (""198"" vs ""37"").
- Jongno-gu and Jongnodistrict can be considered equivalent as ""gu"" means district.
- Since the addresses differ clearly in road name and number, they are not pointing to the same entity.
- The semantics do not match or approximate the same place.

**Response:** ""10:00–18:00""  
**Target:** ""marchtooctober:09:00-18:00\n※saturday:09:00-20:00""

- Target hours vary by month and day; main general hours are 09:00–18:00 in March to October.
- Response states ""10:00–18:00,"" which overlaps only partially in hours, starting one hour later than the reference.
- The response does not mention the more detailed Saturday hours or the specific March-October time frame.
- However, the criterion allows ignoring closure dates, but time range is slightly off.
- Since the semantics (general opening hours) differ by one hour in the start time, and since the response lacks the weekday/weekend distinction, it does not exactly match the reference but provides a partially matching time range.
- The question is whether ""10:00–18:00"" can be considered ""approximately the same"" as ""09:00-18:00 march to october, sat 09:00-20:00.""
- Because the start time is off by one hour and no mention of months or Saturdays, it only partially matches.
- But the criterion says it's sufficient if semantics are approximately the same or point to the same entity.
- Here, the entity is opening hours. The 10:00 start vs 09:00 start isn't a big semantic deviation; the closing time is the same.
- Therefore, the response is largely correct (only a minor shift in start time).

- The target specifies Monday, Tuesday, Thursday, Friday, Sunday 10:00-18:00; Wednesday and Saturday 10:00-21:00.
- The response says ""weekdays"" 10:00–18:00, technically weekdays usually means Mon-Fri, but target includes Sunday also with 10:00-18:00.
- The difference is in the Sunday: target says Sunday 10:00–18:00, response does not mention Sunday.
- The response explicitly mentions Wednesday and Saturday late openings matching target.
- The difference is minor (missing Sunday mention).
- The criterion states approximate semantics or same entity is sufficient.
- Since ""weekdays"" are mostly the same as Monday, Tuesday, Thursday, Friday, Sunday is missed.
- Given Sunday is part of “weekend” in normal classification, and the response misses it.
