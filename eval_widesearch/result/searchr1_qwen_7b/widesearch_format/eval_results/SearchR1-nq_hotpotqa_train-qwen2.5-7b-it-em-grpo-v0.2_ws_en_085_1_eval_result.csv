### Analysis

**idx_0:**  
- Response: ""115""  
- Target: ""106min""  
Are the responses semantically the same or pointing to the same entity? No, 115 ≠ 106; they differ by 9 units. Presumably these numbers represent times in minutes. Since the numbers differ significantly, they likely do not satisfy ""approximately the same"" as the criterion suggests.  
Score: 0

**idx_1:**  
- Response: ""117""  
- Target: ""112min""  
Difference is 5. Again, unless 5 minutes difference is considered ""approximately the same,"" which is unlikely here, they are different. The criterion does not explicitly define allowable numeric deviation but says ""approximately the same."" Usually, a difference of 5 minutes is not negligible if these are specific target values. So mark as incorrect.  
Score: 0

**idx_2:**  
- Response: ""122""  
- Target: ""118min""  
Difference 4. Same reasoning as above. Not the same entity and not approximately the same semantics.  
Score: 0

**idx_3:**  
- Response: ""106""  
- Target: ""123min""  
Difference 17, clearly different.  
Score: 0

**idx_4:**  
- Response: ""107""  
- Target: ""124min""  
Difference 17, different.  
Score: 0

**idx_5:**  
- Response: ""107""  
- Target: ""126min""  
Difference 19, different.  
Score: 0

**idx_6:**  
- Response: ""120""  
- Target: ""132min""  
Difference 12, different.  
Score: 0

---

### Summary

All responses are numerical values close but not matching the targets. The criterion allows approximate semantics and pointing to the same entity, but a difference of 4 to 19 minutes does not reasonably satisfy ""approximately the same,"" especially since these are discrete values presumably measuring the same thing.

Therefore, all scores are 0.

The response does not explicitly mention thriller or an accepted synonym.

Analysis: Target refers to sci-fi and adventure, response has sci-fi but not adventure, and drama instead. Given that sci-fi (sciencefiction) is present, partial semantic match exists. The criterion allows approximate or relevant content. So the presence of sci-fi is relevant to sciencefiction in the target.  
Score: 1

### idx_5
- Response: ""drama,sci-fi""

### Analysis

**idx_0:**  
- Response: ""115""  
- Target: ""106min""  
Are the responses semantically the same or pointing to the same entity? No, 115 ≠ 106; they differ by 9 units. Presumably these numbers represent times in minutes. Since the numbers differ significantly, they likely do not satisfy ""approximately the same"" as the criterion suggests.  
Score: 0

**idx_1:**  
- Response: ""117""  
- Target: ""112min""  
Difference is 5. Again, unless 5 minutes difference is considered ""approximately the same,"" which is unlikely here, they are different. The criterion does not explicitly define allowable numeric deviation but says ""approximately the same."" Usually, a difference of 5 minutes is not negligible if these are specific target values. So mark as incorrect.  
Score: 0

**idx_2:**  
- Response: ""122""  
- Target: ""118min""  
Difference 4. Same reasoning as above. Not the same entity and not approximately the same semantics.

**idx_3:**  
- Response: ""106""  
- Target: ""123min""

**idx_6:**  
- Response: ""120""  
- Target: ""132min""  
Difference 12, different.  
Score: 0

---

### Summary

All responses are numerical values close but not matching the targets. The criterion allows approximate semantics and pointing to the same entity, but a difference of 4 to 19 minutes does not reasonably satisfy ""approximately the same,"" especially since these are discrete values presumably measuring the same thing.

Therefore, all scores are 0.

Criterion summary:  
- Semantics approximately the same or point to the same entity is sufficient.  
- Content only needs to be relevant to the reference answer. Inconsistencies in classification are permitted.  
- Score: 0 or 1.

---

### idx_0
- Response: ""drama,sci-fi""  
- Target: ""drama""  
Analysis: The response includes ""drama"", which exactly matches the target. Extras (""sci-fi"") are allowed since partial matches count as relevance.  
Score: 1

---

### idx_1
- Response: ""drama,war""  
- Target: ""drama""  
Analysis: The response contains ""drama"", the same genre as the target. Extras do not harm.  
Score: 1

---

### idx_2
- Response: ""drama,crime,thriller""  
- Target: ""drama/thriller/crime""  
Analysis: The response includes all three genres listed in the target, just comma separated. Semantically identical.  
Score: 1

---

### idx_3
- Response: ""crime,drama""  
- Target: ""thriller""  
Analysis: Response lacks ""thriller"" but contains ""crime"" and ""drama"". Since ""thriller"" is distinct and not included, this does not fully match the target. The criterion says approximate semantics or pointing to the same entity is sufficient, but crime and thriller are related but distinct genres. The response does not explicitly mention thriller or an accepted synonym.  
Score: 0

---

### idx_4
- Response: ""drama,sci-fi""  
- Target: ""sciencefiction/adventure""  
Analysis: Target refers to sci-fi and adventure, response has sci-fi but not adventure, and drama instead. Given that sci-fi (sciencefiction) is present, partial semantic match exists. The criterion allows approximate or relevant content. So the presence of sci-fi is relevant to sciencefiction in the target.  
Score: 1

---

### idx_5
- Response: ""drama,sci-fi""  
- Target: ""drama,thriller""  
Analysis: Response has drama matching target's drama, replaces thriller with sci-fi. Since drama is matched and sci-fi is extra, the criterion says partial overlap is sufficient.  
Score: 1

---

### idx_6
- Response: ""historicaldrama""  
- Target: ""drama""  
Analysis: ""historical drama"" is a subgenre of ""drama"" so it points to the same entity, semantically relevant.  
Score: 1

Criterion summary:
- The semantics or meaning should be approximately the same as the reference.
- It is sufficient if they point to the same entity.
- No need for exact word-for-word match.
- Scoring is 0 or 1 only.

### Analysis

**idx_0:**  
- Response: ""115""  
- Target: ""106min""  
Are the responses semantically the same or pointing to the same entity? No, 115 ≠ 106; they differ by 9 units. Presumably these numbers represent times in minutes. Since the numbers differ significantly, they likely do not satisfy ""approximately the same"" as the criterion suggests.  
Score: 0

**idx_1:**  
- Response: ""117""  
- Target: ""112min""  
Difference is 5. Again, unless 5 minutes difference is considered ""approximately the same,"" which is unlikely here, they are different. The criterion does not explicitly define allowable numeric deviation but says ""approximately the same."" Usually, a difference of 5 minutes is not negligible if these are specific target values. So mark as incorrect.  
Score: 0

**idx_2:**  
- Response: ""122""  
- Target: ""118min""  
Difference 4. Same reasoning as above. Not the same entity and not approximately the same semantics.  
Score: 0

**idx_3:**  
- Response: ""106""  
- Target: ""123min""  
Difference 17, clearly different.  
Score: 0

**idx_4:**  
- Response: ""107""  
- Target: ""124min""  
Difference 17, different.  
Score: 0

**idx_5:**  
- Response: ""107""  
- Target: ""126min""  
Difference 19, different.  
Score: 0

**idx_6:**  
- Response: ""120""  
- Target: ""132min""  
Difference 12, different.  
Score: 0

---

### Summary

All responses are numerical values close but not matching the targets. The criterion allows approximate semantics and pointing to the same entity, but a difference of 4 to 19 minutes does not reasonably satisfy ""approximately the same,"" especially since these are discrete values presumably measuring the same thing.

Therefore, all scores are 0.
