Criterion recap:  
- Semantics must be approximately the same or point to the same entity.  
- A one-year gap between the answer and the reference answer is allowed.  
- Score is either 0 or 1.

---

**idx_0**  
- Response: ""2019""  
- Target: ""2017""  
- Difference between response and target = 2 years.  
- The allowed difference is 1 year.  
- So, response is not within 1 year of target, hence incorrect. Score = 0.

**idx_1**  
- Response: ""2014""

- Exact match. Score = 1.

Criterion: It is sufficient if the semantics are approximately the same as the reference answer or if they point to the same entity. There is no need for a word-for-word correspondence.

Items:

1. idx_0  
   - Response: ""newyork""  
   - Target: ""newyork""  
   - Analysis: The response matches the target exactly, so it clearly meets the criterion. Score: 1

2. idx_1  
   - Response: ""utah""  
   - Target: ""utah""  
   - Analysis: The response is exactly the target, so it meets the criterion perfectly. Score: 1
