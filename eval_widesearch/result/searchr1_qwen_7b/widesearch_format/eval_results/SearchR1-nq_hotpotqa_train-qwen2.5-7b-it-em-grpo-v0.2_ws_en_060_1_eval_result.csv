""It is sufficient if the semantics are approximately the same as the reference answer or if they point to the same entity.""

We have a response and a target (standard answer) for each idx.

---

**idx_0:**  
- Response: supercell  
- Target: tencent  
Supercell and Tencent are different entities.  
Tencent is a Chinese tech giant; Supercell is a Finnish game company. Tencent owns a majority stake in Supercell, but they are not the same entity. The response is the subsidiary; the target is the parent company.  
The criterion says semantics should be approximately the same or pointing to the same entity. Pointing to the same entity here is strict; since Supercell and Tencent are related but are not interchangeable entities, this would not be considered the same. So score 0.

---

- Response: king
