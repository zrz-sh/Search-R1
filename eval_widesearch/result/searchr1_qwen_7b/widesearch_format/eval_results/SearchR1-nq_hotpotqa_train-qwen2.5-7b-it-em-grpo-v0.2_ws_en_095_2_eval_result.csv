thebequeathed,Alchemy of Souls,,,0.0,"Let's analyze and score each response against the criterion:

Criterion summary:  
- Semantics need to be approximately the same as the reference answer or point to the same entity.  
- No need for exact word match, just semantic equivalence.

---

### idx_0:
- Response: `hallyustaraward,leejae-wook;4thvpchoiceawards,k-dramaseriesoftheyear`
- Target: `/` (which indicates the ""standard answer"" is `/`)

Since the target is simply `/` (a slash), which seems like a placeholder or maybe no actual standard answer is provided, the response contains multiple entities:  
- hallyustaraward  
- leejae-wook  
- 4thvpchoiceawards  
- k-dramaseriesoftheyear

Given there is no standard answer provided beyond `/`, it is unclear what is correct or expected here. Since no standard answer content is available, it is not possible to establish semantic equivalence or match.

Hence:
- Cannot verify semantic equivalence.  
- With no target content, the safe assumption is the response does **not** correspond to the standard answer.

Score: 0

---

### idx_1:
- Response: `bluedragonseriesaward,choyi-hyuninmycountry:thenewage(2019)`  
- Target: `/`

Same as above, the target is simply `/` (a placeholder). The response mentions:  
- bluedragonseriesaward  
- choyi-hyuninmycountry:thenewage(2019)

Again, with no standard answer or target content available (only `/`), no way to check semantic equivalence or correctness.

Score: 0

### Final Scores:

```json
{
    ""idx_0"": 0,
    ""idx_1"": 0
}
```

If the `/` is meant as a placeholding or null answer, responses cannot be said to be semantically correct without any content to judge against. Hence both score zero.",/,"hallyustaraward,leejae-wook;4thvpchoiceawards,k-dramaseriesoftheyear",0.0,"Let's analyze each pair according to the criterion:
