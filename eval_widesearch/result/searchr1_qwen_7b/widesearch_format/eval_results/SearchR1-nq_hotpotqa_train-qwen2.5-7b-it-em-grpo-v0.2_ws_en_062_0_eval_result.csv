- Target: ""universitycouncil""  
- Analysis: Response generic ""council"" vs target specific ""universitycouncil"". We need to decide if ""council"" alone is sufficient. The criterion says approximately same or same entity, but ""council"" is likely too generic and may not point to ""universitycouncil"" specifically (unless further context). Given lack of specificity, this is borderline, but since criterion emphasizes approximate semantics, generic ""council"" can be considered too vague and probably insufficient.  
- Score: 0

### idx_4  
- Same as idx_3: ""council"" vs ""universitycouncil""  
- Same reasoning applies: likely 0.  
- Score: 0

### idx_5  
- Response: ""collegecouncil""  
- Target: ""universitycouncil""  
- Analysis: Different entity (college council is distinct from university council). Not approximate.  
- Score: 0

### idx_6  
- Same as idx_3 and idx_4: ""council"" vs ""universitycouncil""  
- Score: 0

### idx_7  
- Same as above ""council"" vs ""universitycouncil""

### idx_9  
- Response: ""generalassembly,generalboard""

### idx_10

- Score: 0

### idx_11  
- Response: ""council,senate""  
- Target: ""universitycouncil""  
- Analysis: ""council"" (generic) and ""senate"" (different body). The presence of ""council"" only is again generic, not equivalent or approximate enough.

- Response: ""universitycouncil,boardoftrustees""  
- Target: ""boardoftrustees""  
- Analysis: Response contains ""boardoftrustees"" exactly. Extra ""universitycouncil"" is irrelevant but criterion accepts semantics approximate or same entity, having the correct entity included is sufficient.

- Response: ""universitycouncil,generalboardofthefaculties""
