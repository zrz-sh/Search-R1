### Analysis

**idx_0**  
- Response: ""未知"" (unknown)  
- Target: ""约书亚·基米希"" (Joshua Kimmich)  
- ""未知"" does not refer to the same entity ""约书亚·基米希""; it expresses ignorance or unknown answer.  
- So, the response does not fulfill the requirement of referring to the same entity or similar meaning.  
- Score: 0

**idx_1**  
- Response: ""基利安·姆巴佩"" (Kylian Mbappé)  
- Target: ""基利安·姆巴佩"" (Kylian Mbappé)  
- Response exactly matches the target entity.  
- Score: 1

**idx_2**  
- Response: ""玛玛""  
- Target: ""拉斐尔·迪亚斯·贝洛利"" (Rafael Dias Belloli)  
- The response ""玛玛"" is a nickname or different reference? Checking the norm: ""玛玛"" is often used as ""Mama,"" and in some contexts may refer to a person, but here it is a different name compared to the full name ""拉斐尔·迪亚斯·贝洛利.""  
- Since ""玛玛"" does not semantically refer to ""拉斐尔·迪亚斯·贝洛利"" or indicate the same entity clearly, it's a mismatch.  
- Score: 0

**idx_3**  
- Response: ""鲁本·迪亚斯"" (Ruben Dias)  
- Target: ""哈里·凯恩"" (Harry Kane)  
- Different persons entirely in football.  
- No semantic equivalence or pointing to same entity.
