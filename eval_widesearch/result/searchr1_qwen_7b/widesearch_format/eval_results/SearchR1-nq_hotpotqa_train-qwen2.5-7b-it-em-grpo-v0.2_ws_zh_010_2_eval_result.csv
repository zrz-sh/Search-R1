If the responses ""李宗伟"" represent the winner, then the answers are correct, as they provide the winning person's name.

Since all responses say ""李宗伟"" and the target is ""胜,"" it seems that the correct answer to the question ""Who won?"" or ""What is the result?"" is ""李宗伟"" winning.

Translation: The response and the standard answer should express roughly the same meaning or refer to the same entity; exact wording is not necessary.

---

### idx_0
- Response: ""负"" (lose/negative)  
- Target: ""3:2"" (a match score)  

Analysis:  
The target ""3:2"" indicates the match score, presumably indicating the result of a match. The response ""负"" just means ""lose"" or ""negative.""  
""负"" indicates losing, but ""3:2"" is a score that could indicate either side of the scoreline. Without further context, ""负"" is an answer indicating that the entity (player or team) lost, while the target ""3:2"" explicitly states the score. Since the target is a score, and response just says ""lose,"" the meanings are roughly related but not the same entity. If the score ""3:2"" is supposed to represent the final match score (and implicitly that the respondent lost), ""负"" is consistent in a very rough sense.  
However, ""3:2"" is a specific numeric match score, ""负"" is a qualitative result (lose). These do not strictly refer to the same entity - one is a score, another is a result.

Based on criterion (""大致相同"" or ""指向的实体一致""), ""负"" and ""3:2"" are not identical, but if in the question the answer ""3:2"" implies a loss, then ""负"" is pointing to the same match result (lose). However, ""3:2"" itself may also mean the player won 3:2 or lost 2:3 depending on the perspective. Without explicit context, it's hard to be sure.

Given the criterion favors semantic similarity or pointing to the same entity, there's ambiguity. But since ""负"" clearly indicates losing, and ""3:2"" is just a score, these two answers don't refer to the exact same entity. The response is missing the score details.

Strictly, I would have to mark it 0 because ""负"" is not roughly the same as ""3:2"". The standard answer contains a detailed match score; the response only contains a qualitative loss indication.

---

### idx_1
- Response: ""负""  
- Target: ""15-21,21-11,22-20"" (a sequence of game scores implying that the player lost in three sets)

Analysis:  
Again, the response ""负"" just says losing, while the target gives detailed set scores (results of each game). The set scores show a close 3-set match (likely losing since the first set 15-21 is the opponent's score, or vice versa).

The response ""负"" is semantically consistent with the fact that the player lost (which is implied by the detailed set scores). Thus, the response captures the match outcome (lose) but lacks detail.

The criterion states approximate semantic equivalence or pointing to the same entity is sufficient.

Since the target points to a losing match with scores, and response ""负"" just states the loss, they agree at the semantic level: the match was lost.

Hence, score 1.

---

### idx_2
- Response: ""负""  
- Target: ""21-12,21-10"" (two sets scores)

Analysis:  
Target shows two set scores: ""21-12,21-10"" indicates winning the match (with two straight sets).

Response ""负"" states losing.

Here, the response contradicts the target. The target shows a winning score, response indicates losing.

Thus, semantics differ.

Score 0.

| idx   | Response  | Target                | Score Reason                    | Score |

Translation: The response and the standard answer should express roughly the same meaning or refer to the same entity; exact wording is not necessary.

---

### idx_0
- Response: ""负"" (lose/negative)  
- Target: ""3:2"" (a match score)  

Analysis:  
The target ""3:2"" indicates the match score, presumably indicating the result of a match. The response ""负"" just means ""lose"" or ""negative.""  
""负"" indicates losing, but ""3:2"" is a score that could indicate either side of the scoreline. Without further context, ""负"" is an answer indicating that the entity (player or team) lost, while the target ""3:2"" explicitly states the score. Since the target is a score, and response just says ""lose,"" the meanings are roughly related but not the same entity. If the score ""3:2"" is supposed to represent the final match score (and implicitly that the respondent lost), ""负"" is consistent in a very rough sense.  
However, ""3:2"" is a specific numeric match score, ""负"" is a qualitative result (lose). These do not strictly refer to the same entity - one is a score, another is a result.

Based on criterion (""大致相同"" or ""指向的实体一致""), ""负"" and ""3:2"" are not identical, but if in the question the answer ""3:2"" implies a loss, then ""负"" is pointing to the same match result (lose). However, ""3:2"" itself may also mean the player won 3:2 or lost 2:3 depending on the perspective. Without explicit context, it's hard to be sure.

Given the criterion favors semantic similarity or pointing to the same entity, there's ambiguity. But since ""负"" clearly indicates losing, and ""3:2"" is just a score, these two answers don't refer to the exact same entity. The response is missing the score details.

Strictly, I would have to mark it 0 because ""负"" is not roughly the same as ""3:2"". The standard answer contains a detailed match score; the response only contains a qualitative loss indication.

---

### idx_1
- Response: ""负""  
- Target: ""15-21,21-11,22-20"" (a sequence of game scores implying that the player lost in three sets)

Analysis:  
Again, the response ""负"" just says losing, while the target gives detailed set scores (results of each game). The set scores show a close 3-set match (likely losing since the first set 15-21 is the opponent's score, or vice versa).

The response ""负"" is semantically consistent with the fact that the player lost (which is implied by the detailed set scores). Thus, the response captures the match outcome (lose) but lacks detail.

The criterion states approximate semantic equivalence or pointing to the same entity is sufficient.

Since the target points to a losing match with scores, and response ""负"" just states the loss, they agree at the semantic level: the match was lost.

Hence, score 1.

---

### idx_2
- Response: ""负""  
- Target: ""21-12,21-10"" (two sets scores)

Analysis:  
Target shows two set scores: ""21-12,21-10"" indicates winning the match (with two straight sets).

Response ""负"" states losing.

Here, the response contradicts the target. The target shows a winning score, response indicates losing.

Thus, semantics differ.

Score 0.

题目要求的评分标准是：和参考答案语义相同大致，或者指向的实体一致即可，不需要字字对应。

1. idx_0:
- 参考答案（target）为：“负”
- 回答（response）为：“nan”
- “nan”通常表示“不是数字”或“无效值”，语义与“负”完全不一致，且指向实体也不是“负”。
- 根据标准，语义不一致，得分应为0。

2. idx_1:
- 参考答案为：“/”
- 回答为：“nan”
- “nan”与“/”没有语义相同或者实体一致的关联，得分为0。

3. idx_2:
- 参考答案为：“胜”
- 回答为：“nan”
- 同理，“nan”和“胜”语义不符，也不是指向相同实体，得分为0。

1. idx_0  
   - Response: '15-21,21-19,21-17'

   - The response is a sequence of scores (probably match scores), while the target is '日本' (Japan) which is a country/entity.  
   - The response does not match the target in meaning or entity.  
   - Since the criterion states that semantics or entity should be aligned, this is not aligned.

Criterion: ""和参考答案语义相同大致、或者指向的实体一致即可，不需要字字对应。""  
Translation: The response and the standard answer should express roughly the same meaning or refer to the same entity; exact wording is not necessary.

---

### idx_0
- Response: ""负"" (lose/negative)  
- Target: ""3:2"" (a match score)  

Analysis:  
The target ""3:2"" indicates the match score, presumably indicating the result of a match. The response ""负"" just means ""lose"" or ""negative.""  
""负"" indicates losing, but ""3:2"" is a score that could indicate either side of the scoreline. Without further context, ""负"" is an answer indicating that the entity (player or team) lost, while the target ""3:2"" explicitly states the score. Since the target is a score, and response just says ""lose,"" the meanings are roughly related but not the same entity. If the score ""3:2"" is supposed to represent the final match score (and implicitly that the respondent lost), ""负"" is consistent in a very rough sense.  
However, ""3:2"" is a specific numeric match score, ""负"" is a qualitative result (lose). These do not strictly refer to the same entity - one is a score, another is a result.

Based on criterion (""大致相同"" or ""指向的实体一致""), ""负"" and ""3:2"" are not identical, but if in the question the answer ""3:2"" implies a loss, then ""负"" is pointing to the same match result (lose). However, ""3:2"" itself may also mean the player won 3:2 or lost 2:3 depending on the perspective. Without explicit context, it's hard to be sure.

Given the criterion favors semantic similarity or pointing to the same entity, there's ambiguity. But since ""负"" clearly indicates losing, and ""3:2"" is just a score, these two answers don't refer to the exact same entity. The response is missing the score details.

Strictly, I would have to mark it 0 because ""负"" is not roughly the same as ""3:2"". The standard answer contains a detailed match score; the response only contains a qualitative loss indication.

---

### idx_1
- Response: ""负""  
- Target: ""15-21,21-11,22-20"" (a sequence of game scores implying that the player lost in three sets)

Analysis:  
Again, the response ""负"" just says losing, while the target gives detailed set scores (results of each game). The set scores show a close 3-set match (likely losing since the first set 15-21 is the opponent's score, or vice versa).

The response ""负"" is semantically consistent with the fact that the player lost (which is implied by the detailed set scores). Thus, the response captures the match outcome (lose) but lacks detail.

The criterion states approximate semantic equivalence or pointing to the same entity is sufficient.

Since the target points to a losing match with scores, and response ""负"" just states the loss, they agree at the semantic level: the match was lost.

Hence, score 1.

---

### idx_2
- Response: ""负""  
- Target: ""21-12,21-10"" (two sets scores)

Analysis:  
Target shows two set scores: ""21-12,21-10"" indicates winning the match (with two straight sets).

Response ""负"" states losing.

Here, the response contradicts the target. The target shows a winning score, response indicates losing.

Thus, semantics differ.

Score 0.

---

### Summary of scoring:

| idx   | Response  | Target                | Score Reason                    | Score |
|-------|-----------|-----------------------|--------------------------------|-------|
| idx_0 | 负         | 3:2                   | Score vs. qualitative ""lose"" unclear equivalence, no detailed score, ambiguous | 0     |
| idx_1 | 负         | 15-21,21-11,22-20     | Both indicate losing           | 1     |
| idx_2 | 负         | 21-12,21-10           | Response says lose, target indicates win | 0     |

","21-12,21-10",负,0.0,"First, I carefully analyze each pair of response and target according to the criterion: ""和参考答案语义相同大致、或者指向的实体一致即可，不需要字字对应。"" That means semantic equivalence or referring to the same entity is enough, without needing exact word-for-word matching.

Item-by-item analysis:

- idx_0:
  - response: ""/""
  - target: ""胜"" (means ""win"")
  - The response ""/"" does not convey the meaning of ""胜"" or refer to that entity. It's just a slash symbol with no semantic equivalence.
  - So this fails the criterion.

- idx_1:
  - response: ""/""
  - target: ""负"" (means ""lose"")
  - Again, ""/"" is not semantically equivalent to ""负"" or the same entity.
  - Fails the criterion.

- idx_2:
  - response: ""/""
  - target: ""胜"" (win)
  - Same as idx_0.
  - Fails the criterion.

Therefore, none of the responses matches or is semantically equivalent to the respective targets.

1. idx_0:  
- Target: ""苏杯混团锦标赛"" (Sudirman Cup mixed team championship)  
- Response: ""团体"" (team)  
Analysis:  
""团体"" means ""team,"" which is a broader term but clearly points to the same category/entity as ""混团锦标赛"" (mixed team championship). Thus, the response matches the entity indicated by the target. It is semantically consistent and sufficiently specific.  
Score: 1

---

2. idx_1:  
- Target: ""奥运会"" (Olympic Games)  
- Response: ""个人"" (individual)

""奥运会"" is the event; ""个人"" means an individual, which describes a category of competition rather than the event itself. The response ""个人"" and the target ""奥运会"" are not the same entity or roughly the same semantic meaning.

- Score: 0

---

**idx_1**  
- Response: ""亚军"" (runner-up)  
- Target: ""4强"" (top 4)  
- Analysis: ""亚军"" is specifically 2nd place; ""4强"" refers to the top four teams/players. While the runner-up is indeed part of the ""4强,"" the terms are not equivalent. The response is more specific than the target but does not mean the same or point to the same entity as a whole. According to the criterion, they must be semantically similar or point to the same entity. Since ""亚军"" is a subset of ""4强,"" but not the same entity, it's arguable, but strict interpretation suggests they are not the same entity (response is a smaller entity within the target set). So by criterion, this should be marked 0.  
- Score: 0

### Analysis:

- **idx_0**  
  Target: ""苏杯"" (Sudirman Cup)  
  Response: ""男单"" (Men's Singles)  
  These two are not semantically equivalent. ""苏杯"" refers to a specific badminton team event, while ""男单"" refers to a category of match (men's singles). They are distinct and do not point to the same entity.
