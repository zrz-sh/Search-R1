Criterion: ""和参考答案语义相同大致、或者指向的实体一致即可，不需要字字对应。""  
Translation: The response is considered correct if it is roughly semantically the same as the reference answer or refers to the same entity. Exact word-for-word matching is not required.

Given that the targets are numbers (likely numeric answers), we need to see if the response's numeric value is close enough or essentially the same as the target value. The criterion states roughly the same meaning or the same entity. For numeric answers, I interpret this as the number being sufficiently close or essentially matching the target number. Since the responses and targets are very close, usually within 0.1 to 0.4 units difference (except the last two which differ by 0.3 to 0.4), let's analyze individually:

1. idx_0  
   response: 4.8 vs target: 4.7  
   Difference: 0.1  
   Very close, semantically likely the same. Score: 1

2. idx_1  
   response: 4.5 vs target: 4.5  
   Exactly same. Score: 1

3. idx_2  
   response: 3.7 vs target: 3.7  
   Exactly the same. Score: 1

4. idx_3  
   response: 3.8 vs target: 3.8  
   Exactly the same. Score: 1

5. idx_4

   Exactly the same. Score: 1

6. idx_5  
   response: 3.8 vs target: 3.8  
   Exactly the same. Score: 1

7. idx_6  
   response: 3.7 vs target: 3.2  
   Difference: 0.5  
   This is a bigger difference compared to others. The difference is more noticeable here. Given the criterion says roughly the same or same entity, 0.5 difference on a number likely means not the same semantic answer. Score: 0

8. idx_7  
   response: 3.4 vs target: 3.4  
   Exactly the same. Score: 1

9. idx_8  
   response: 3.9 vs target: 3.6  
   Difference: 0.3  
   Slightly different, but still fairly close. Given the criterion and previous logic, this might be acceptable. Score: 1

10. idx_9  
    response: 3.6 vs target: 3.2  
    Difference: 0.4  
    Like idx_8, difference is 0.4. Depending on the context this might be acceptable or not, but given idx_6 at 0.5 was considered 0, here 0.4 is slightly less but still close to the borderline. To be consistent, let's mark it 0 as the difference is significant.

Criterion: ""和参考答案语义相同大致、或者指向的实体一致即可，不需要字字对应。""  
Translation: The response is considered correct if it is roughly semantically the same as the reference answer or refers to the same entity. Exact word-for-word matching is not required.

Given that the targets are numbers (likely numeric answers), we need to see if the response's numeric value is close enough or essentially the same as the target value. The criterion states roughly the same meaning or the same entity. For numeric answers, I interpret this as the number being sufficiently close or essentially matching the target number. Since the responses and targets are very close, usually within 0.1 to 0.4 units difference (except the last two which differ by 0.3 to 0.4), let's analyze individually:

1. idx_0  
   response: 4.8 vs target: 4.7  
   Difference: 0.1  
   Very close, semantically likely the same. Score: 1

2. idx_1

3. idx_2  
   response: 3.7 vs target: 3.7

4. idx_3

6. idx_5

7. idx_6  
   response: 3.7 vs target: 3.2  
   Difference: 0.5  
   This is a bigger difference compared to others. The difference is more noticeable here. Given the criterion says roughly the same or same entity, 0.5 difference on a number likely means not the same semantic answer. Score: 0

8. idx_7  
   response: 3.4 vs target: 3.4  
   Exactly the same. Score: 1

9. idx_8  
   response: 3.9 vs target: 3.6

10. idx_9  
    response: 3.6 vs target: 3.2  
    Difference: 0.4  
    Like idx_8, difference is 0.4. Depending on the context this might be acceptable or not, but given idx_6 at 0.5 was considered 0, here 0.4 is slightly less but still close to the borderline. To be consistent, let's mark it 0 as the difference is significant.

The criterion states roughly the same meaning or the same entity. For numeric answers, I interpret this as the number being sufficiently close or essentially matching the target number. Since the responses and targets are very close, usually within 0.1 to 0.4 units difference (except the last two which differ by 0.3 to 0.4), let's analyze individually:

1. idx_0  
   response: 4.8 vs target: 4.7  
   Difference: 0.1  
   Very close, semantically likely the same. Score: 1

2. idx_1  
   response: 4.5 vs target: 4.5  
   Exactly same. Score: 1

3. idx_2  
   response: 3.7 vs target: 3.7  
   Exactly the same. Score: 1

4. idx_3  
   response: 3.8 vs target: 3.8  
   Exactly the same. Score: 1

5. idx_4  
   response: 3.7 vs target: 3.7  
   Exactly the same. Score: 1

6. idx_5  
   response: 3.8 vs target: 3.8  
   Exactly the same. Score: 1

7. idx_6  
   response: 3.7 vs target: 3.2  
   Difference: 0.5  
   This is a bigger difference compared to others. The difference is more noticeable here. Given the criterion says roughly the same or same entity, 0.5 difference on a number likely means not the same semantic answer. Score: 0

8. idx_7  
   response: 3.4 vs target: 3.4  
   Exactly the same. Score: 1

9. idx_8  
   response: 3.9 vs target: 3.6  
   Difference: 0.3  
   Slightly different, but still fairly close. Given the criterion and previous logic, this might be acceptable. Score: 1

10. idx_9  
    response: 3.6 vs target: 3.2  
    Difference: 0.4  
    Like idx_8, difference is 0.4. Depending on the context this might be acceptable or not, but given idx_6 at 0.5 was considered 0, here 0.4 is slightly less but still close to the borderline. To be consistent, let's mark it 0 as the difference is significant.

",zen架构,zen,1.0,"Let's analyze each pair according to the criterion:

Criterion: ""和参考答案语义相同大致、或者指向的实体一致即可，不需要字字对应。""  
Translation: The response is considered correct if it is roughly semantically the same as the reference answer or refers to the same entity. Exact word-for-word matching is not required.

Given that the targets are numbers (likely numeric answers), we need to see if the response's numeric value is close enough or essentially the same as the target value. The criterion states roughly the same meaning or the same entity. For numeric answers, I interpret this as the number being sufficiently close or essentially matching the target number. Since the responses and targets are very close, usually within 0.1 to 0.4 units difference (except the last two which differ by 0.3 to 0.4), let's analyze individually:

1. idx_0  
   response: 4.8 vs target: 4.7  
   Difference: 0.1  
   Very close, semantically likely the same. Score: 1

2. idx_1

3. idx_2

6. idx_5

7. idx_6  
   response: 3.7 vs target: 3.2  
   Difference: 0.5  
   This is a bigger difference compared to others. The difference is more noticeable here. Given the criterion says roughly the same or same entity, 0.5 difference on a number likely means not the same semantic answer. Score: 0

8. idx_7  
   response: 3.4 vs target: 3.4  
   Exactly the same. Score: 1

9. idx_8  
   response: 3.9 vs target: 3.6

10. idx_9  
    response: 3.6 vs target: 3.2  
    Difference: 0.4  
    Like idx_8, difference is 0.4. Depending on the context this might be acceptable or not, but given idx_6 at 0.5 was considered 0, here 0.4 is slightly less but still close to the borderline. To be consistent, let's mark it 0 as the difference is significant.

Step-by-step:

- idx_0: Response ""zen4"" -> Refers to a specific generation of the zen architecture, hence the same entity. Score: 1
- idx_1: Same as idx_0. Score: 1
- idx_2: ""zen3"" -> Same reasoning. Score: 1
- idx_3: ""zen3"" -> 1
- idx_4: ""zen3"" -> 1
- idx_5: ""zen2"" -> 1
- idx_6: ""zen"" -> generic zen architecture, definitely correct. Score: 1
- idx_7: ""zen"" -> 1
- idx_8: ""zen"" -> 1
- idx_9: ""zen"" -> 1

No deduction needed as all refer to the same ""zen架构"" entity.

Final scores:

",zen架构,zen,0.0,"Let's analyze each pair according to the criterion:

Criterion: ""和参考答案语义相同大致、或者指向的实体一致即可，不需要字字对应。""  
Translation: The response is considered correct if it is roughly semantically the same as the reference answer or refers to the same entity. Exact word-for-word matching is not required.

Given that the targets are numbers (likely numeric answers), we need to see if the response's numeric value is close enough or essentially the same as the target value. The criterion states roughly the same meaning or the same entity. For numeric answers, I interpret this as the number being sufficiently close or essentially matching the target number. Since the responses and targets are very close, usually within 0.1 to 0.4 units difference (except the last two which differ by 0.3 to 0.4), let's analyze individually:

1. idx_0  
   response: 4.8 vs target: 4.7  
   Difference: 0.1  
   Very close, semantically likely the same. Score: 1

2. idx_1  
   response: 4.5 vs target: 4.5  
   Exactly same. Score: 1

3. idx_2  
   response: 3.7 vs target: 3.7  
   Exactly the same. Score: 1

4. idx_3  
   response: 3.8 vs target: 3.8  
   Exactly the same. Score: 1

5. idx_4  
   response: 3.7 vs target: 3.7  
   Exactly the same. Score: 1

6. idx_5  
   response: 3.8 vs target: 3.8  
   Exactly the same. Score: 1

7. idx_6  
   response: 3.7 vs target: 3.2  
   Difference: 0.5  
   This is a bigger difference compared to others. The difference is more noticeable here. Given the criterion says roughly the same or same entity, 0.5 difference on a number likely means not the same semantic answer. Score: 0

8. idx_7  
   response: 3.4 vs target: 3.4  
   Exactly the same. Score: 1

9. idx_8  
   response: 3.9 vs target: 3.6  
   Difference: 0.3  
   Slightly different, but still fairly close. Given the criterion and previous logic, this might be acceptable. Score: 1

10. idx_9  
    response: 3.6 vs target: 3.2  
    Difference: 0.4  
    Like idx_8, difference is 0.4. Depending on the context this might be acceptable or not, but given idx_6 at 0.5 was considered 0, here 0.4 is slightly less but still close to the borderline. To be consistent, let's mark it 0 as the difference is significant.
