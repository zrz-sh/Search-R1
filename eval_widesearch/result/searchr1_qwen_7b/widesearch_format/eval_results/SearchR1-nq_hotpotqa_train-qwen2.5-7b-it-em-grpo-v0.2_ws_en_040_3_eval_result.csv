### Analyze idx_0:
- response: ""social""
- target: ""socialmedia""
""social"" and ""socialmedia"" are considered approximately same semantics (social media apps are social apps).
**Score: 1**

idx_1:
- response: ""social""
- target: ""messaging""
""social"" vs ""messaging"" — different categories. Messaging is a type of communication; social is broad, but not exact or approximate. Not good enough.
**Score: 0**

idx_2:
- response: ""social""
- target: ""socialmedia""
Same as idx_0.
**Score: 1**

idx_3:
- response: ""communication""
- target: ""socialmedia""
""communication"" and ""socialmedia"" — social media apps enable communication, semantics close/overlapping.
Criterion allows approximate semantics.
**Score: 1**

idx_4:
- response: ""communication""
- target: ""communication""
Same exact.
**Score: 1**

idx_5:
- response: ""social""
- target: ""messaging""
Same as idx_1
**Score: 0**

idx_6:
- response: ""social""
- target: ""socialmedia""
==> 1

idx_7:
- response: ""communication""
- target: ""messaging""
""communication"" and ""messaging"" are semantically close (messaging is specific communication)
**Score: 1**

idx_8:
- response: ""communication""
- target: ""communication""
Exact
**Score: 1**

idx_9:
- response: ""productivity""
- target: ""entertainment""
Different semantics
**Score: 0**

idx_10:
- response: ""social""
- target: ""socialmedia""
==> 1

idx_11:
- response: ""social""
- target: ""socialmedia""

idx_14:
- response: ""communication""
- target: ""messaging""
==> 1

idx_15:
- response: ""social""
- target: ""socialmedia""
==> 1

idx_16:
- response: ""social""
- target: ""communication""
Is ""social"" approximate to ""communication""? They overlap but are not the same. Social is broader, communication is more specific. The criterion mentions approximate semantics are sufficient. Given social apps are communication apps, accepted.
**Score: 1**

idx_17:
- response: ""communication""
- target: ""messaging""
==> 1

idx_18:
- response: ""communication""
- target: ""photo&video""
""communication"" vs ""photo&video"" — different categories, not semantically close enough.
**Score: 0**

idx_19:
- response: ""productivity""
- target: ""music""
Different
**Score: 0**

idx_20:
- response: ""social""
- target: ""socialmedia""

""social"" and ""socialmedia"" are considered approximately same semantics (social media apps are social apps).
**Score: 1**

idx_1:
- response: ""social""

idx_16:
- response: ""social""
- target: ""communication""
Is ""social"" approximate to ""communication""? They overlap but are not the same. Social is broader, communication is more specific. The criterion mentions approximate semantics are sufficient. Given social apps are communication apps, accepted.

**Score: 1**

idx_1:
- response: ""social""
- target: ""messaging""
""social"" vs ""messaging"" — different categories. Messaging is a type of communication; social is broad, but not exact or approximate. Not good enough.

idx_15:
- response: ""social""
- target: ""socialmedia""
==> 1

idx_16:
- response: ""social""
- target: ""communication""
Is ""social"" approximate to ""communication""? They overlap but are not the same. Social is broader, communication is more specific. The criterion mentions approximate semantics are sufficient. Given social apps are communication apps, accepted.

### Analyze idx_0:
- response: ""social""

""social"" and ""socialmedia"" are considered approximately same semantics (social media apps are social apps).
**Score: 1**

idx_1:
- response: ""social""
- target: ""messaging""
""social"" vs ""messaging"" — different categories. Messaging is a type of communication; social is broad, but not exact or approximate. Not good enough.
**Score: 0**

idx_2:
- response: ""social""
- target: ""socialmedia""
Same as idx_0.
**Score: 1**

idx_3:
- response: ""communication""
- target: ""socialmedia""
""communication"" and ""socialmedia"" — social media apps enable communication, semantics close/overlapping.
Criterion allows approximate semantics.
**Score: 1**

idx_4:
- response: ""communication""
- target: ""communication""
Same exact.
**Score: 1**

idx_5:
- response: ""social""
- target: ""messaging""
Same as idx_1
**Score: 0**

idx_6:
- response: ""social""
- target: ""socialmedia""
==> 1

idx_7:
- response: ""communication""
- target: ""messaging""
""communication"" and ""messaging"" are semantically close (messaging is specific communication)
**Score: 1**

idx_8:
- response: ""communication""
- target: ""communication""
Exact
**Score: 1**

idx_9:
- response: ""productivity""
- target: ""entertainment""
Different semantics
**Score: 0**

- target: ""messaging""
==> 1

idx_15:
- response: ""social""
- target: ""socialmedia""
==> 1

idx_16:
- response: ""social""
- target: ""communication""
Is ""social"" approximate to ""communication""? They overlap but are not the same. Social is broader, communication is more specific. The criterion mentions approximate semantics are sufficient. Given social apps are communication apps, accepted.
**Score: 1**

idx_17:
- response: ""communication""
- target: ""messaging""
==> 1

idx_18:
- response: ""communication""
- target: ""photo&video""
""communication"" vs ""photo&video"" — different categories, not semantically close enough.

### Analyze idx_0:
- response: ""social""
- target: ""socialmedia""
""social"" and ""socialmedia"" are considered approximately same semantics (social media apps are social apps).
**Score: 1**

idx_1:
- response: ""social""
- target: ""messaging""
""social"" vs ""messaging"" — different categories. Messaging is a type of communication; social is broad, but not exact or approximate. Not good enough.
**Score: 0**

idx_2:
- response: ""social""
- target: ""socialmedia""
Same as idx_0.
**Score: 1**

idx_3:
- response: ""communication""
- target: ""socialmedia""
""communication"" and ""socialmedia"" — social media apps enable communication, semantics close/overlapping.
Criterion allows approximate semantics.
**Score: 1**

idx_4:
- response: ""communication""
- target: ""communication""
Same exact.
**Score: 1**

idx_5:
- response: ""social""
- target: ""messaging""
Same as idx_1
**Score: 0**

idx_6:
- response: ""social""
- target: ""socialmedia""
==> 1

idx_7:
- response: ""communication""
- target: ""messaging""
""communication"" and ""messaging"" are semantically close (messaging is specific communication)
**Score: 1**

idx_8:
- response: ""communication""
- target: ""communication""
Exact
**Score: 1**

idx_9:
- response: ""productivity""
- target: ""entertainment""
Different semantics
**Score: 0**

idx_10:
- response: ""social""
- target: ""socialmedia""
==> 1

- response: ""communication""
- target: ""messaging""
==> 1

idx_15:
- response: ""social""
- target: ""socialmedia""
==> 1

idx_16:
- response: ""social""
- target: ""communication""
Is ""social"" approximate to ""communication""? They overlap but are not the same. Social is broader, communication is more specific. The criterion mentions approximate semantics are sufficient. Given social apps are communication apps, accepted.
**Score: 1**

idx_17:
- response: ""communication""
- target: ""messaging""
==> 1

idx_18:
- response: ""communication""
- target: ""photo&video""
""communication"" vs ""photo&video"" — different categories, not semantically close enough.
**Score: 0**

idx_19:
- response: ""productivity""
- target: ""music""
Different
**Score: 0**

idx_20:
- response: ""social""
- target: ""socialmedia""

### Analyze idx_0:
- response: ""social""
- target: ""socialmedia""
""social"" and ""socialmedia"" are considered approximately same semantics (social media apps are social apps).
**Score: 1**

idx_1:
- response: ""social""
- target: ""messaging""
""social"" vs ""messaging"" — different categories. Messaging is a type of communication; social is broad, but not exact or approximate. Not good enough.
**Score: 0**

idx_2:
- response: ""social""
- target: ""socialmedia""
Same as idx_0.
**Score: 1**

idx_3:
- response: ""communication""
- target: ""socialmedia""
""communication"" and ""socialmedia"" — social media apps enable communication, semantics close/overlapping.
Criterion allows approximate semantics.
**Score: 1**

idx_4:
- response: ""communication""
- target: ""communication""
Same exact.
**Score: 1**

idx_5:
- response: ""social""
- target: ""messaging""
Same as idx_1
**Score: 0**

idx_6:
- response: ""social""
- target: ""socialmedia""
==> 1

idx_7:
- response: ""communication""
- target: ""messaging""
""communication"" and ""messaging"" are semantically close (messaging is specific communication)
**Score: 1**

idx_8:
- response: ""communication""
- target: ""communication""
Exact
**Score: 1**

idx_9:
- response: ""productivity""
- target: ""entertainment""
Different semantics
**Score: 0**

idx_10:
- response: ""social""
- target: ""socialmedia""
==> 1

- response: ""communication""
- target: ""messaging""
==> 1

idx_15:
- response: ""social""
- target: ""socialmedia""
==> 1

idx_16:
- response: ""social""
- target: ""communication""
Is ""social"" approximate to ""communication""? They overlap but are not the same. Social is broader, communication is more specific. The criterion mentions approximate semantics are sufficient. Given social apps are communication apps, accepted.
**Score: 1**

idx_17:
- response: ""communication""
- target: ""messaging""
==> 1

idx_18:
- response: ""communication""
- target: ""photo&video""
""communication"" vs ""photo&video"" — different categories, not semantically close enough.
**Score: 0**

idx_19:
- response: ""productivity""
- target: ""music""
Different
**Score: 0**

idx_20:
- response: ""social""
- target: ""socialmedia""

### Analyze idx_0:
- response: ""social""
- target: ""socialmedia""
""social"" and ""socialmedia"" are considered approximately same semantics (social media apps are social apps).
**Score: 1**

idx_1:
- response: ""social""
- target: ""messaging""
""social"" vs ""messaging"" — different categories. Messaging is a type of communication; social is broad, but not exact or approximate. Not good enough.
**Score: 0**

idx_2:
- response: ""social""
- target: ""socialmedia""
Same as idx_0.
**Score: 1**

idx_3:
- response: ""communication""
- target: ""socialmedia""
""communication"" and ""socialmedia"" — social media apps enable communication, semantics close/overlapping.
Criterion allows approximate semantics.
**Score: 1**

idx_4:
- response: ""communication""
- target: ""communication""
Same exact.
**Score: 1**

idx_5:
- response: ""social""
- target: ""messaging""
Same as idx_1
**Score: 0**

idx_6:
- response: ""social""
- target: ""socialmedia""
==> 1

idx_7:
- response: ""communication""
- target: ""messaging""
""communication"" and ""messaging"" are semantically close (messaging is specific communication)
**Score: 1**

idx_8:
- response: ""communication""
- target: ""communication""
Exact
**Score: 1**

idx_9:
- response: ""productivity""
- target: ""entertainment""
Different semantics
**Score: 0**

idx_10:
- response: ""social""
- target: ""socialmedia""
==> 1

idx_11:
- response: ""social""
- target: ""socialmedia""
==> 1

idx_14:
- response: ""communication""
- target: ""messaging""
==> 1

idx_15:
- response: ""social""
- target: ""socialmedia""
==> 1

idx_16:
- response: ""social""
- target: ""communication""
Is ""social"" approximate to ""communication""? They overlap but are not the same. Social is broader, communication is more specific. The criterion mentions approximate semantics are sufficient. Given social apps are communication apps, accepted.
**Score: 1**

idx_17:
- response: ""communication""
- target: ""messaging""
==> 1

idx_18:
- response: ""communication""
- target: ""photo&video""
""communication"" vs ""photo&video"" — different categories, not semantically close enough.
**Score: 0**

idx_19:
- response: ""productivity""
- target: ""music""
Different
**Score: 0**

idx_20:
- response: ""social""
- target: ""socialmedia""

### Analyze idx_0:
- response: ""social""
- target: ""socialmedia""
""social"" and ""socialmedia"" are considered approximately same semantics (social media apps are social apps).
**Score: 1**

idx_1:
- response: ""social""
- target: ""messaging""
""social"" vs ""messaging"" — different categories. Messaging is a type of communication; social is broad, but not exact or approximate. Not good enough.
**Score: 0**

idx_2:
- response: ""social""
- target: ""socialmedia""
Same as idx_0.
**Score: 1**

idx_3:
- response: ""communication""
- target: ""socialmedia""
""communication"" and ""socialmedia"" — social media apps enable communication, semantics close/overlapping.
Criterion allows approximate semantics.
**Score: 1**

idx_4:
- response: ""communication""
- target: ""communication""
Same exact.
**Score: 1**

idx_5:
- response: ""social""
- target: ""messaging""
Same as idx_1
**Score: 0**

idx_6:
- response: ""social""
- target: ""socialmedia""
==> 1

idx_7:
- response: ""communication""
- target: ""messaging""
""communication"" and ""messaging"" are semantically close (messaging is specific communication)
**Score: 1**

idx_8:
- response: ""communication""
- target: ""communication""
Exact
**Score: 1**

idx_9:
- response: ""productivity""
- target: ""entertainment""
Different semantics
**Score: 0**

idx_10:
- response: ""social""
- target: ""socialmedia""
==> 1

idx_11:
- response: ""social""
- target: ""socialmedia""

idx_14:
- response: ""communication""
- target: ""messaging""
==> 1

idx_15:
- response: ""social""
- target: ""socialmedia""
==> 1

idx_16:
- response: ""social""
- target: ""communication""
Is ""social"" approximate to ""communication""? They overlap but are not the same. Social is broader, communication is more specific. The criterion mentions approximate semantics are sufficient. Given social apps are communication apps, accepted.
**Score: 1**

idx_17:
- response: ""communication""
- target: ""messaging""
==> 1

idx_18:
- response: ""communication""
- target: ""photo&video""
""communication"" vs ""photo&video"" — different categories, not semantically close enough.
**Score: 0**

idx_19:
- response: ""productivity""
- target: ""music""
Different
**Score: 0**

idx_20:
- response: ""social""
- target: ""socialmedia""

### Analyze idx_0:
- response: ""social""

""social"" and ""socialmedia"" are considered approximately same semantics (social media apps are social apps).
**Score: 1**

idx_1:
- response: ""social""
- target: ""messaging""
""social"" vs ""messaging"" — different categories. Messaging is a type of communication; social is broad, but not exact or approximate. Not good enough.
**Score: 0**

idx_2:
- response: ""social""
- target: ""socialmedia""
Same as idx_0.

idx_3:
- response: ""communication""

""communication"" and ""socialmedia"" — social media apps enable communication, semantics close/overlapping.
Criterion allows approximate semantics.
**Score: 1**

idx_4:
- response: ""communication""
- target: ""communication""
Same exact.
**Score: 1**

idx_5:
- response: ""social""
- target: ""messaging""
Same as idx_1
**Score: 0**

idx_6:
- response: ""social""
- target: ""socialmedia""

idx_7:
- response: ""communication""
- target: ""messaging""
""communication"" and ""messaging"" are semantically close (messaging is specific communication)
**Score: 1**

idx_8:
- response: ""communication""
- target: ""communication""
Exact
**Score: 1**

idx_9:
- response: ""productivity""
- target: ""entertainment""
Different semantics

- target: ""messaging""
==> 1

idx_15:
- response: ""social""
- target: ""socialmedia""
==> 1

idx_16:
- response: ""social""
- target: ""communication""
Is ""social"" approximate to ""communication""? They overlap but are not the same. Social is broader, communication is more specific. The criterion mentions approximate semantics are sufficient. Given social apps are communication apps, accepted.
**Score: 1**

idx_17:
- response: ""communication""
- target: ""messaging""
==> 1

""social"" and ""socialmedia"" are considered approximately same semantics (social media apps are social apps).
**Score: 1**

idx_1:
- response: ""social""
- target: ""messaging""
""social"" vs ""messaging"" — different categories. Messaging is a type of communication; social is broad, but not exact or approximate. Not good enough.

idx_7:
- response: ""communication""
- target: ""messaging""
""communication"" and ""messaging"" are semantically close (messaging is specific communication)

idx_15:
- response: ""social""
- target: ""socialmedia""
==> 1

idx_16:
- response: ""social""
- target: ""communication""
Is ""social"" approximate to ""communication""? They overlap but are not the same. Social is broader, communication is more specific. The criterion mentions approximate semantics are sufficient. Given social apps are communication apps, accepted.
**Score: 1**

idx_17:
- response: ""communication""
- target: ""messaging""
==> 1

idx_18:
- response: ""communication""
- target: ""photo&video""
