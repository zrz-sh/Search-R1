**idx_10**  
response: ""california/oregon""  
target: ""california""  
Response includes an extra entity ""oregon"" that is not in the target. This means the response is more inclusive than the target. The criterion says it is sufficient if semantics are approximately the same or point to the same entity. However, here the response contains more than the target. Is that acceptable?

Usually, providing more than reference entities when there is only one target is considered incorrect or only partially correct, but our criterion only states semantics must be approximately the same or point to the same entity.

Including an additional entity not in target might fail this criterion, since it points to at least one entity beyond the target. So it does not map to the same entity set and is not approximately the same in semantics because it adds an extra entity. So score should be 0.

response: ""california/oregon""

Response includes an extra entity ""oregon"" that is not in the target. This means the response is more inclusive than the target. The criterion says it is sufficient if semantics are approximately the same or point to the same entity. However, here the response contains more than the target. Is that acceptable?

Usually, providing more than reference entities when there is only one target is considered incorrect or only partially correct, but our criterion only states semantics must be approximately the same or point to the same entity.

Including an additional entity not in target might fail this criterion, since it points to at least one entity beyond the target. So it does not map to the same entity set and is not approximately the same in semantics because it adds an extra entity. So score should be 0.

Score: 1

**idx_10**  
response: ""california/oregon""  
target: ""california""  
Response includes an extra entity ""oregon"" that is not in the target. This means the response is more inclusive than the target. The criterion says it is sufficient if semantics are approximately the same or point to the same entity. However, here the response contains more than the target. Is that acceptable?

Usually, providing more than reference entities when there is only one target is considered incorrect or only partially correct, but our criterion only states semantics must be approximately the same or point to the same entity.

Including an additional entity not in target might fail this criterion, since it points to at least one entity beyond the target. So it does not map to the same entity set and is not approximately the same in semantics because it adds an extra entity. So score should be 0.

response: ""california/oregon""  
target: ""california""  
Response includes an extra entity ""oregon"" that is not in the target. This means the response is more inclusive than the target. The criterion says it is sufficient if semantics are approximately the same or point to the same entity. However, here the response contains more than the target. Is that acceptable?

Usually, providing more than reference entities when there is only one target is considered incorrect or only partially correct, but our criterion only states semantics must be approximately the same or point to the same entity.

Including an additional entity not in target might fail this criterion, since it points to at least one entity beyond the target. So it does not map to the same entity set and is not approximately the same in semantics because it adds an extra entity. So score should be 0.

- The response mentions Springdale, which matches the city. The target is clearly Zion National Park, while the response only shows a PO Box in Springdale.  
- If the PO Box belongs to Zion NP administration, they would be semantically the same entity.  
- However, since response does not mention Zion NP explicitly, it’s uncertain.  
- Criterion: approximate semantics or same entity is sufficient. The response lacks mention of the park name; only the city and PO Box are given.

Score: 1

**idx_10**  
response: ""california/oregon""  
target: ""california""  
Response includes an extra entity ""oregon"" that is not in the target. This means the response is more inclusive than the target. The criterion says it is sufficient if semantics are approximately the same or point to the same entity. However, here the response contains more than the target. Is that acceptable?

Usually, providing more than reference entities when there is only one target is considered incorrect or only partially correct, but our criterion only states semantics must be approximately the same or point to the same entity.

Including an additional entity not in target might fail this criterion, since it points to at least one entity beyond the target. So it does not map to the same entity set and is not approximately the same in semantics because it adds an extra entity. So score should be 0.

Score: 1

**idx_10**  
response: ""california/oregon""  
target: ""california""  
Response includes an extra entity ""oregon"" that is not in the target. This means the response is more inclusive than the target. The criterion says it is sufficient if semantics are approximately the same or point to the same entity. However, here the response contains more than the target. Is that acceptable?

Usually, providing more than reference entities when there is only one target is considered incorrect or only partially correct, but our criterion only states semantics must be approximately the same or point to the same entity.

Including an additional entity not in target might fail this criterion, since it points to at least one entity beyond the target. So it does not map to the same entity set and is not approximately the same in semantics because it adds an extra entity. So score should be 0.

- Response: PO Box in Springdale, UT 84763

- Different ZIP codes but close (84763 vs 84767). The response is a PO Box, while target is a street address at Zion National Park.  
- The response mentions Springdale, which matches the city. The target is clearly Zion National Park, while the response only shows a PO Box in Springdale.  
- If the PO Box belongs to Zion NP administration, they would be semantically the same entity.  
- However, since response does not mention Zion NP explicitly, it’s uncertain.  
- Criterion: approximate semantics or same entity is sufficient. The response lacks mention of the park name; only the city and PO Box are given.

Score: 1

---

**idx_10**  
response: ""california/oregon""  
target: ""california""  
Response includes an extra entity ""oregon"" that is not in the target. This means the response is more inclusive than the target. The criterion says it is sufficient if semantics are approximately the same or point to the same entity. However, here the response contains more than the target. Is that acceptable?

Usually, providing more than reference entities when there is only one target is considered incorrect or only partially correct, but our criterion only states semantics must be approximately the same or point to the same entity.

Including an additional entity not in target might fail this criterion, since it points to at least one entity beyond the target. So it does not map to the same entity set and is not approximately the same in semantics because it adds an extra entity. So score should be 0.

Score: 1

**idx_10**  
response: ""california/oregon""  
target: ""california""  
Response includes an extra entity ""oregon"" that is not in the target. This means the response is more inclusive than the target. The criterion says it is sufficient if semantics are approximately the same or point to the same entity. However, here the response contains more than the target. Is that acceptable?

Usually, providing more than reference entities when there is only one target is considered incorrect or only partially correct, but our criterion only states semantics must be approximately the same or point to the same entity.

Including an additional entity not in target might fail this criterion, since it points to at least one entity beyond the target. So it does not map to the same entity set and is not approximately the same in semantics because it adds an extra entity. So score should be 0.

- Response: PO Box in Springdale, UT 84763  
- Target: Zion National Park street address, Springdale, UT 84767  
- Different ZIP codes but close (84763 vs 84767). The response is a PO Box, while target is a street address at Zion National Park.  
- The response mentions Springdale, which matches the city. The target is clearly Zion National Park, while the response only shows a PO Box in Springdale.  
- If the PO Box belongs to Zion NP administration, they would be semantically the same entity.  
- However, since response does not mention Zion NP explicitly, it’s uncertain.  
- Criterion: approximate semantics or same entity is sufficient. The response lacks mention of the park name; only the city and PO Box are given.  
- Due to lack of explicit matching entity (Zion National Park), and the addresses are postal vs physical in Nature, this likely counts as different.

- Both in Bar Harbor, same ZIP  
- Addresses differ in format (street vs PO Box), but same city and ZIP. This is a plausible match if both belong to the same entity, e.g., a park service address could have both street and PO Box.  
- However, the addresses themselves are different entities (street vs PO Box). Without additional context, these are distinct.

- If both belong to the same entity (e.g., park service), they can be considered approximate same entity. But with no explicit name given, the response and target addresses are not semantically equivalent.
