Criterion: It is sufficient if the semantics are approximately the same as the reference answer or if they point to the same entity.

The responses and targets:

- idx_0: response = ""nan"", target = ""1m""
- idx_1: response = ""nan"", target = ""1m""
- idx_2: response = ""nan"", target = ""200k""
- idx_3: response = ""200k"", target = ""200k""

- idx_8: response = ""nan"", target = ""128k""

""nan"" indicates presumably ""not a number"" or no answer — this is clearly not consistent with targets like ""1m"", ""200k"", etc.

Only idx_3 has a matching response = target = ""200k"".

All other responses are ""nan"", which is not semantically the same as their respective targets.

Thus:

- idx_0 to idx_2: response is ""nan"", target is a number → score 0
- idx_3: response is ""200k"", target ""200k"" → score 1
- idx_4 to idx_8: response is ""nan"", target is a number → score 0
