Criterion summary:  
- Semantics approximately the same as the reference or pointing to the same entity is sufficient.  
- No strict word-for-word match needed.  

---

**idx_0**  
- Response: ""alaska""  
- Target: ""alaska""  
- Exact match; clearly pointing to the same entity.  
- Score: 1

**idx_1**  
- Response: ""montana,northdakota""  
- Target: ""montana""  
- The response includes the correct answer ""montana"" plus an additional entity ""northdakota"".  
- Criterion states ""semantics approximately the same"" or pointing to the same entity is sufficient; however, extra entities are not explicitly penalized here. The question could have requested a single entity, but no rule penalizes inclusion of an extra valid entity. Technically, including extra correct items often leads to partial credit, but here scoring is binary (0 or 1) and no deduction stated.  
- However, since the response also includes the correct entity ""montana,"" it should be accepted as correct.
