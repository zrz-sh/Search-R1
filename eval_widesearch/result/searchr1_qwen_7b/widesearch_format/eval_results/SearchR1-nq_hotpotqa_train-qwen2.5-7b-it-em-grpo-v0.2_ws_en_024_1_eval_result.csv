Detailed analysis:

- idx_0: response='—', target='e-trade'  
  Response is a dash, no meaningful answer. Target is ""e-trade"". Not matching. Score=0.

- idx_1: response='—', target='e-trade'  
  Same as above. Score=0.

- idx_2: response='—', target='at&twireless'  
  Response is a dash, no meaningful answer. Target is ""at&twireless"". No match. Score=0.

- idx_3: response='pepsi', target='aoltopspeed'  
  Response 'pepsi' and target 'aoltopspeed' are different entities. No match. Score=0.

- idx_4: response='budweiser', target='ameriquestmortgage'  
  Different entities. Score=0.

- idx_5: response='budlight', target='sprintnextel'  
  Different entities. Score=0.

- idx_6: response='pepsi', target='pepsi'  
  Exact same, Score=1.

- idx_7: response='budweiser', target='bridgestone'  
  Different entities. Score=0.

- idx_8: response='budlight', target='bridgestone'  
  Different entities. Score=0.

- idx_9: response='pepsi', target='bridgestone'  
  Different entities. Score=0.

- idx_10: response='budlight', target='bridgestone'  
  Different entities. Score=0.

- idx_11: response='pepsi', target='bridgestone'  
  Different entities. Score=0.

  Same entity. Score=1.

- idx_13: response='budlight', target='pepsi'  
  Different entities. Score=0.

- idx_14: response='pepsi', target='pepsi'  
  Same entity. Score=1.

- idx_15: response='budlight', target='pepsi'  
  Different entities. Score=0.

- idx_16: response='pepsi', target='pepsizerosugar'  
  Semantic approximation or pointing to the same entity?  
  ""pepsizerosugar"" is a product variant of Pepsi. Since criterion accepts approximate semantics or same entity, I would consider ""pepsi"" as acceptable for ""pepsizerosugar"". Score=1.

- idx_17: response='pepsi', target='pepsi'  
  Same. Score=1.

- idx_18: response='budlight', target='pepsi'  
  Different entities. Score=0.
