Criterion summary:  
- The response should have approximate semantic equivalence or point to the same entity as the target.  
- It suffices if the response matches one or more entities in the reference answer. Having a few extra entities is allowed.

---

### idx_0  
Response: ""sabrinacarpenter,amyallen,stephjones,julianbunetta""  
Target: ""amyallen,julianbunetta,stephjones,sabrinacarpenter""  

- The response contains all four names in the target, just ordered differently.  
- This is a perfect match, so score = 1.

### idx_1  
Response: ""bensonboone""  
Target: ""evanblair,jacklafrantz,bensonboone""  

- The response contains one entity from the target list out of three.  
- Since the criterion allows partial matches (one or more entities counted), and it suffices to match only one, this qualifies.  
- Having fewer than the full list is acceptable.  
- So score = 1.

### idx_2  
Response: ""billieeilish""  
Target: ""finneaso'connell,billieeilisho'connell""  

- The target has two entities: ""finneaso'connell"" and ""billieeilisho'connell"" (which looks like ""billieeilish o'connell"" combined).  
- The response has only ""billieeilish"".  
- The criterion is about semantic equivalence or pointing to the same entity. ""billieeilish"" matches with ""billieeilisho'connell"" (likely the same person).  
- Thus, although not word-for-word, the same entity is named.  
- Hence, score = 1.

### idx_3  
Response: ""sabrinacarpenter,amyallen,stephjones,julianbunetta""  
Target: ""amyallen,julianbunetta,stephjones,sabrinacarpenter""  

- Identical scenario as idx_0.  
- All entities match, order different.  
- Score = 1.

### idx_4  
Response: ""kendricklamar""  
Target: ""dijonmcfarlane,kendricklamar,markanthonyspears,raycharles,seanmomberger""  

- Response has one name from the target list: ""kendricklamar"".  
- Criterion allows partial matches with one or more.  
- Score = 1.

### idx_5  
Response: ""shaboozey""  
Target: ""collinsobinnachibueze,jerreljones,joekent,markwilliams,nevinsastry,seancook""  

- Response has ""shaboozey"".  
- Target has six different names, none matching ""shaboozey"".  
- No semantic equivalence or the same entity.  
- Therefore, score = 0.

Criterion summary:  
- The response should have approximate semantic equivalence or point to the same entity as the target.  
- It suffices if the response matches one or more entities in the reference answer. Having a few extra entities is allowed.

---

### idx_0  
Response: ""sabrinacarpenter,amyallen,stephjones,julianbunetta""  
Target: ""amyallen,julianbunetta,stephjones,sabrinacarpenter""  

- The response contains all four names in the target, just ordered differently.  
- This is a perfect match, so score = 1.

### idx_1  
Response: ""bensonboone""  
Target: ""evanblair,jacklafrantz,bensonboone""  

- The response contains one entity from the target list out of three.  
- Since the criterion allows partial matches (one or more entities counted), and it suffices to match only one, this qualifies.  
- Having fewer than the full list is acceptable.  
- So score = 1.

### idx_2  
Response: ""billieeilish""  
Target: ""finneaso'connell,billieeilisho'connell""  

- The target has two entities: ""finneaso'connell"" and ""billieeilisho'connell"" (which looks like ""billieeilish o'connell"" combined).  
- The response has only ""billieeilish"".  
- The criterion is about semantic equivalence or pointing to the same entity. ""billieeilish"" matches with ""billieeilisho'connell"" (likely the same person).  
- Thus, although not word-for-word, the same entity is named.  
- Hence, score = 1.

### idx_3  
Response: ""sabrinacarpenter,amyallen,stephjones,julianbunetta""  
Target: ""amyallen,julianbunetta,stephjones,sabrinacarpenter""  

- Identical scenario as idx_0.  
- All entities match, order different.  
- Score = 1.

### idx_4  
Response: ""kendricklamar""  
Target: ""dijonmcfarlane,kendricklamar,markanthonyspears,raycharles,seanmomberger""  

- Response has one name from the target list: ""kendricklamar"".  
- Criterion allows partial matches with one or more.  
- Score = 1.

### idx_5  
Response: ""shaboozey""  
Target: ""collinsobinnachibueze,jerreljones,joekent,markwilliams,nevinsastry,seancook""  

- Response has ""shaboozey"".  
- Target has six different names, none matching ""shaboozey"".  
- No semantic equivalence or the same entity.  
- Therefore, score = 0.
