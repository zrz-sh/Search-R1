### idx_0  
- Response: ""约100-51200""  
- Target: ""iso100-51200""  
Analysis:  
- The response gives an ISO range approximately from 100 to 51200.  
- The target is ISO range from 100 to 51200 as well.  
- Both refer to the same entity: ISO from 100 to 51200.  
- The response omits the ""iso"" prefix but the entity clearly matches and the value is the same.

- Response gives ISO range approximately 100 to 25600.  
- Target is 100 to 51200.  
- The upper bound in the response is lower than the target.  
- The response's upper limit is half of the target's upper limit.  
- According to the criterion, the response and target should be roughly the same meaning or refer to the same entity.  
- Here it's a significantly narrower ISO range, and not equivalent or referring to the same entity/range.  
- The answer should be considered incorrect. Score = 0.

Criterion:  
- The response should have roughly the same meaning as the target or refer to the same entity.  
- Exact wording is not required.

Pairs:

1. idx_0:  
   - Response: ""expeed6""  
   - Target: ""双expeed6"" (means ""dual expeed6"")  
   - Analysis:  
     The target implies ""dual expeed6"" (more than one unit) while the response only states ""expeed6"" (singular). Since the meaning here is slightly different: one specifies two of them, the other just one. However, according to the criterion, semantic closeness or entity reference is enough and not strict word-to-word match.  
     Are ""expeed6"" and ""双expeed6"" referring to the same entity? Not exactly, one is dual and the other is single. Since the instruction says ""semantic meaning roughly the same or referring to the same entity"", the plural ""dual expeed6"" is more specific; ""expeed6"" alone does not completely capture that. Thus, they do not point to exactly the same entity or meaning. The response loses some meaning.  
     Conclusion: score 0.

2. idx_1:  
   - Response: ""expeed6""  
   - Target: ""expeed6""  
   - Exact match, meaning same entity, so score 1.

**Item idx_0**  
- Response: 约2528万  
- Target: 约2,450万  
- Analysis: Both refer to an approximate value in the range of about 24 to 25 million. 2528万 is about 25.28 million, 2450万 is 24.5 million. The difference is about 1 million, which is roughly 4% difference.  
- The criterion says approximate or same entity is enough. 1 million difference on that scale is not large, and since both are approximate numbers it is acceptable. So this response essentially aligns with the target value.

Criterion:  
- The response should have roughly the same meaning as the target or refer to the same entity.  
- Exact wording is not required.

Pairs:

1. idx_0:  
   - Response: ""expeed6""  
   - Target: ""双expeed6"" (means ""dual expeed6"")  
   - Analysis:  
     The target implies ""dual expeed6"" (more than one unit) while the response only states ""expeed6"" (singular). Since the meaning here is slightly different: one specifies two of them, the other just one. However, according to the criterion, semantic closeness or entity reference is enough and not strict word-to-word match.  
     Are ""expeed6"" and ""双expeed6"" referring to the same entity? Not exactly, one is dual and the other is single. Since the instruction says ""semantic meaning roughly the same or referring to the same entity"", the plural ""dual expeed6"" is more specific; ""expeed6"" alone does not completely capture that. Thus, they do not point to exactly the same entity or meaning. The response loses some meaning.  
     Conclusion: score 0.

2. idx_1:  
   - Response: ""expeed6""  
   - Target: ""expeed6""  
   - Exact match, meaning same entity, so score 1.

3. idx_2:

**Item idx_0**  
- Response: 约2528万  
- Target: 约2,450万  
- Analysis: Both refer to an approximate value in the range of about 24 to 25 million. 2528万 is about 25.28 million, 2450万 is 24.5 million. The difference is about 1 million, which is roughly 4% difference.  
- The criterion says approximate or same entity is enough. 1 million difference on that scale is not large, and since both are approximate numbers it is acceptable. So this response essentially aligns with the target value.
