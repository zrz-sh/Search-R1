Criterion summary: It's sufficient if the semantics are approximately the same as the reference answer or if they point to the same entity. No need for exact word-for-word match.

---

**idx_0**  
- Response: ""499.99""  
- Target: ""$379.99""  
Analysis:  
- The response number differs from the target number.  
- No currency symbol is included to indicate equivalence.  
- The values are materially different, so the semantics of the price are not approximately the same. They clearly point to different amounts.  
- Therefore, this should be scored 0.

---

**idx_1**  
- Response: ""nan""  
- Target: ""¥2990""  
Analysis:  
- ""nan"" is not a number, means Not A Number.  
- Target is a price with Japanese Yen symbol and amount 2990.  
- The response does not reflect the actual amount or currency, so semantics do not match.  
- Result: 0.

**idx_2**  
- Response: ""nan""  
- Target: ""¥45000""  
Analysis:  
- Same as idx_1, ""nan"" doesn't represent the price or currency.  
- No semantic match.  
- Result: 0.
