---

### idx_0

- **Standard answer (target):** ""houston,tx;mcallen,tx""
- **Response:** ""unknown""

**Analysis:**

- The response ""unknown"" does not provide any entity or location corresponding to the targets ""houston,tx"" and ""mcallen,tx"".
- The criterion states that the semantics need to be approximately the same or refer to the same entity.
- Here, ""unknown"" does not match the reference entities in any way.
- Therefore, the response does not meet the criterion and should get a score of 0.

---

### idx_1

- **Standard answer (target):** ""brownsville,tx;corpuschristi,tx;laredo,tx;mcallen,tx""
- **Response:** ""unknown""

**Analysis:**

- Similar to idx_0, the response is ""unknown,"" which does not correspond semantically or entity-wise to the targets.
- Again, the response does not convey information relating to any of the cities given.
- This fails to meet the criterion; thus, the score should be 0.

Analysis:

- The target answer refers to specific offices related to the U.S. Attorney's office, specifically the ""Executive Office for U.S. Attorneys and the Office of the U.S. Attorneys, United States Attorney's Office, Southern District Texas.""
- The response ""usajobs"" is a general job portal for U.S. government jobs, but it is not an office or entity equivalent or similar to the target entity.

### idx_0

- Target: ""$63,163-$165,209peryear""  
- Response: ""$63,163""

Analysis:  
- The target is a salary range from $63,163 to $165,209 per year.  
- The response only gives the lower bound of that range, ""$63,163"".  
- By giving only part of the salary range, the semantics are incomplete as it doesn't indicate the full expected range.  
- The response does not fully capture the reference answer, but it does point clearly to part of the target range.  
- Given the criterion, the semantics need to be approximately the same or point to the same entity. Here, the response only partially points to the entity (only the lower bound).  
- Since the standard answer involves a range, and the response is only a single point (lower bound), the semantics are not equivalent.  
- Therefore, we should score 0 because it is not approximately the same; it only specifies part of it.

### idx_1

- Target: ""$63,163-$165,209peryear""  
- Response: ""$219,321""

Analysis:  
- The response is a number outside the range in the target answer (much higher than the max).  
- The semantics are entirely different.  
- The response does not point to the same entity or approximate the reference answer.
