Criterion summary:  
- The response is considered correct if the semantics are approximately the same as the reference answer or if they point to the same entity.

**idx_0**  
- Response: ""pepsi,britneyspears,aerosmith,nsync""  
- Target: ""e-trade""  
- Analysis: The response mentions several unrelated entities (Pepsi, Britney Spears, Aerosmith, NSYNC) which are different from the target ""e-trade"". They do not refer to the same entity or concept, nor are the semantics the same.  
- Score: 0

**idx_1**  
- Response: ""at&twireless""  
- Target: ""e-trade""  
- Analysis: The response and the target are different entities. The semantics do not correspond.
