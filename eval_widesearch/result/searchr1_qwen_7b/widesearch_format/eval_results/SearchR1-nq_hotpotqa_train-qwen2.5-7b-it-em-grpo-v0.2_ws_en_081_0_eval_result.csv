baldur'sgate3,Baldur's Gate 3,,,1.0,key_match,0.0,"Let's analyze each response-target pair step by step:

---

**idx_0**  
- Response: ""ninjagaiden4""  
- Target: ""nan""

Analysis:  
- The target is ""nan"", which presumably means no standard answer or ""not a number""/no valid reference answer provided.  
- The criterion states: ""It is sufficient if the semantics are approximately the same as the reference answer or if they point to the same entity."" But if the target is ""nan"", it means there is no correct answer to compare against.  
- Since there is no reference answer, the response cannot be judged as correct or incorrect based on meaning. Usually, such cases get a score of 0 because no valid target answer exists for matching.

Conclusion: score = 0

---

**idx_1**  
- Response: ""hadesii""  
- Target: ""armoredcorevi:firesofrubicon""

Analysis:  
- The response ""hadesii"" (likely meaning ""Hades II"") and the target ""armoredcorevi:firesofrubicon"" are different entities, different game titles.  
- The criterion notes equivalence in semantics or same entity. Here, the games are different; so the response does not match the target.  
- Hence, score = 0

---

**idx_2**  
- Response: ""doom:thedarkages""  
- Target: ""nan""

Analysis:  
- Again the target is ""nan"", i.e., no valid reference answer. Same as idx_0.  
- The response cannot be assessed for correctness in relation to nonexistent target.  
- Following logic above, score = 0

Criterion:
- It is sufficient if the semantics are approximately the same as the reference answer or if they point to the same entity.
- No need for word-for-word correspondence.

**idx_0**  
- Response: ""larianstudios""  
- Target: ""larianstudios""  
- Analysis: Exact match, clearly the same entity.  
- Score: 1

---

**idx_1**  
- Response: ""fromsoftware""  
- Target: ""bandainamcoentertainment""  
- Analysis: These are two different entities (FromSoftware is a game developer, Bandai Namco Entertainment is a publisher). They do not point to the same entity and are not semantically equivalent.  
- Score: 0

---

**idx_2**  
- Response: ""respawnentertainment""  
- Target: ""electronicarts""  
- Analysis: Respawn Entertainment is a developer acquired by Electronic Arts. However, they are distinct entities — one is a developer studio, the other is a publisher parent company. Since the criterion demands semantics to be approximately the same or point to the same entity, this does not apply here because they are different entities. Respawn Entertainment is not equal to Electronic Arts. So this should be 0.
