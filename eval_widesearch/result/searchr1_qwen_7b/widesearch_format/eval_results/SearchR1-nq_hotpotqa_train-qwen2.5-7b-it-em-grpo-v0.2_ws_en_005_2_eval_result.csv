Criterion: Sufficient if semantics are approximately the same or they point to the same entity. No need for exact wording.

---

### idx_0  
- Response: ""4.1(weighted)""  
- Target: ""no minimum gpa specified (but applicants below 3.0 must supply extra evidence)""  
Analysis:  
- Target says no minimum GPA specified, but extra evidence for <3.0.  
- Response gives a GPA value 4.1, which is a specific GPA, implying a minimum that is not none.  
- Since the target explicitly says no minimum GPA specified, response contradicts this.  
Score = 0

---

### idx_1  
- Response: ""4.15(weighted)""  
- Target: ""gpa≥2.5/4.0""  
Analysis:  
- Target minimum GPA is 2.5 on a 4.0 scale.  
- Response says 4.15 (weighted), suggesting a GPA more than 4.0, which is not possible on 4.0 scale.  
- Response is inconsistent with the target.  
- They do not semantically align.  
Score = 0

---

### idx_2  
- Response: ""4.19(weighted)""  
- Target: ""gpa≥2.7/4.0""  
Analysis:  
- Target minimum GPA is 2.7.  
- Response says 4.19 on a 4.0 scale (weighted presumably), which is invalid or at least contradictory.  
- Does not semantically match.  
Score = 0

---

### idx_3  
- Response: ""3.7+""  
- Target: ""no minimum gpa specified""  
Analysis:  
- Target says no minimum GPA specified.  
- Response indicates 3.7+ minimum GPA. This contradicts target.  
Score = 0

---

### idx_4  
- Response: ""3.7+""  
- Target: ""no minimum gpa specified""  
- Same as idx_3.  
Score = 0

---

### idx_5  
- Response: ""4.0""  
- Target: ""no minimum gpa specified""  
- Response says 4.0 (suggesting exact or minimum). Target says no minimum. Contradiction.  
Score = 0

---

### idx_6  
- Response: ""3.7+""  
- Target: ""no minimum gpa specified""  
- Same as previous similar.  
Score = 0

### idx_7  
- Response: ""3.7+""  
- Target: ""no minimum gpa specified""  
- Same as previous.  
Score = 0

---

### idx_8  
- Response: ""no minimum gpa specified""  
- Target: ""gpa≥5.0/7.0""  
- Response says no minimum, target says minimum 5.0 on 7 scale. Contradiction.  
Score = 0

---

### idx_9  
- Response: ""no minimum gpa specified""  
- Target: ""wam≥65%""  
- WAM is similar to GPA but percentage-based. Target has a minimum 65%, response indicates none. Semi-related but target clearly states a minimum.  
- Semantics differ: no minimum vs a required minimum.  
Score = 0

---

### idx_10  
- Response: ""no minimum gpa specified""  
- Target: ""wam≥65%""  
- Same as idx_9.  
Score = 0

---

### idx_11  
- Response: ""no minimum gpa specified""  
- Target: ""wam≥65%""  
- Same reasoning.  
Score = 0

---

### idx_12  
- Response: ""no minimum gpa specified""  
- Target: ""gpa≥5.0/7.0""  
- Same as idx_8, contradiction.  
Score = 0

,,universityofqueensland,UQ,1.0,"Let's analyze each pair item by item according to the criterion:

Criterion:  
- The semantics should be approximately the same as the reference answer or point to the same entity.  
- Word-for-word match is not necessary.  
- Score 1 if the response correctly points to the same entity or has approximately the same semantics; otherwise 0.

---

### Analysis:

- idx_0 to idx_7:  
  Response = ""ivyleague"", Target = ""ivyleague""  
  They are exactly the same. Score = 1.

- idx_8 to idx_12:  
  Response = ""groupofeight"", Target = ""groupofeight""  
  They are exactly the same. Score = 1.

All responses perfectly match their targets or are semantically the same entity.

Criterion:  
- It is sufficient if the semantics are approximately the same as the reference answer or if they point to the same entity.  
- No need for word-for-word match.  

---

**idx_0 to idx_7**:  
- Response: ""usa""  
- Target: ""us""  
- ""usa"" and ""us"" both refer to the entity ""United States"". Semantically they are the same entity despite the slight difference in abbreviation.  
- According to the criterion, this is sufficient.  
- Score = 1 for each.  

**idx_8 to idx_12**:  
- Response: ""australia""  
- Target: ""australia""  
- Exact match, so score = 1 for each.  

---

No deductions needed as all responses point to the same entity as the target answers.
