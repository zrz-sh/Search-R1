- Target: ""attheintersectionofthesouthernareaoffultoncounty,atlanta,unitedstatesandclaytoncounty,itis12.6kilometersnorthofdowntownatlanta.""  

Response and target both describe a location near downtown Atlanta, USA, with similar geographical references. Although wording differs slightly (south vs. north), the general area is close. The response mentions ""south of downtown Atlanta district near interstates"" and the target says ""intersection in southern area of Fulton County, Atlanta and Clayton County... 12.6 km north of downtown Atlanta."" There is a directional conflict: south vs. north, but both mention Atlanta area near interstates and districts. Since the criterion accepts approximate semantics, but conflicting directions might mean they don't point to the same entity. ""South of downtown Atlanta"" and ""north of downtown Atlanta"" are distinct locations, so they are not semantically the same place. Therefore, no approximate equivalence.

Response and target both describe a location near downtown Atlanta, USA, with similar geographical references. Although wording differs slightly (south vs. north), the general area is close. The response mentions ""south of downtown Atlanta district near interstates"" and the target says ""intersection in southern area of Fulton County, Atlanta and Clayton County... 12.6 km north of downtown Atlanta."" There is a directional conflict: south vs. north, but both mention Atlanta area near interstates and districts. Since the criterion accepts approximate semantics, but conflicting directions might mean they don't point to the same entity. ""South of downtown Atlanta"" and ""north of downtown Atlanta"" are distinct locations, so they are not semantically the same place. Therefore, no approximate equivalence.

- Target: ""attheintersectionofthesouthernareaoffultoncounty,atlanta,unitedstatesandclaytoncounty,itis12.6kilometersnorthofdowntownatlanta.""  

Response and target both describe a location near downtown Atlanta, USA, with similar geographical references. Although wording differs slightly (south vs. north), the general area is close. The response mentions ""south of downtown Atlanta district near interstates"" and the target says ""intersection in southern area of Fulton County, Atlanta and Clayton County... 12.6 km north of downtown Atlanta."" There is a directional conflict: south vs. north, but both mention Atlanta area near interstates and districts. Since the criterion accepts approximate semantics, but conflicting directions might mean they don't point to the same entity. ""South of downtown Atlanta"" and ""north of downtown Atlanta"" are distinct locations, so they are not semantically the same place. Therefore, no approximate equivalence.

### idx_4  
- Response: ""10misouthofdowntownatlantadistrict,nearinterstates20,75,85,and285""  
- Target: ""attheintersectionofthesouthernareaoffultoncounty,atlanta,unitedstatesandclaytoncounty,itis12.7kilometersnorthofdowntownatlanta.""  

Same as idx_2 but distance slightly different (12.7 km vs 12.6 km). The previous reasoning applies: directional conflict (south vs. north), so not the same entity or approximate semantics.  
**Score: 0**

### idx_5  
- Response: ""dubai,unitedarabemirates""  
- Target: ""attheborderofdallascountyandtarrantcountyinthestateoftexas,unitedstates""  

Same as idx_3. Different locations, no approximate equivalence.  
**Score: 0**

### idx_6  
- Response: ""10misouthofdowntownatlantadistrict,nearinterstates20,75,85,and285""  
- Target: ""attheintersectionofthesouthernareaoffultoncounty,atlanta,unitedstatesandclaytoncounty,itis12.8kilometersnorthofdowntownatlanta.""  

Same situation as idx_2 and idx_4. South vs. north directional conflict. Not approximate same semantics.  
**Score: 0**

### idx_7  
- Response: ""dubai,unitedarabemirates""  
- Target: ""algarhoudarea,2.6nauticalmileseastofdubai.""  

Response is city and country: Dubai, UAE. Target is a specific area near Dubai. Since ""algarhoud area"" is a part of Dubai or adjacent area in Dubai, and the response is the broader entity Dubai, this can be regarded as pointing to the same entity (Dubai) approximately, with less detail. Criterion allows approximate semantics.

### idx_8  
- Response: ""10misouthofdowntownatlantadistrict,nearinterstates20,75,85,and285""  
- Target: ""attheintersectionofthesouthernareaoffultoncounty,atlanta,unitedstatesandclaytoncounty,itis12.9kilometersnorthofdowntownatlanta.""  

Same reasoning as idx_2,4,6. Direction conflict, so not approximate.  
**Score: 0**

---

### idx_9  
- Response: ""dubai,unitedarabemirates""  
- Target: ""algarhoudarea,2.7nauticalmileseastofdubai.""  

Same reasoning as idx_7: ""Dubai"" and ""Area near Dubai"" approximately same entity.
