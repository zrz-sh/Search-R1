**idx_0**  
- Response: ""6.2\""""  
- Target: ""6.2inches""  
- Analysis: Both represent the same measurement ""6.2 inches"". The use of "" in"" or ""\"""" (inch symbol) is equivalent in this context.  
- Score: 1  

**idx_1**  
- Response: ""6.2\""""  
- Target: ""6.2inches""  
- Same as idx_0.  
- Score: 1  

**idx_2**  
- Response: ""6.1\""""  
- Target: ""6.1inches""  
- Same as above but 6.1 instead of 6.2; both values match exactly.  
- Score: 1  

**idx_3**  
- Response: ""6.1\""""  
- Target: ""6.1inches""  
- Same as idx_2.  
- Score: 1  

**idx_4**  
- Response: ""6.1\""""  
- Target: ""6.2inches""  
- The numerical values differ (6.1 vs 6.2). This means different measurements, not approximately the same.  
- Score: 0  

**idx_5**  
- Response: ""6.1\""""  
- Target: ""6.2inches""  
- Same as idx_4, values differ.  
- Score: 0
