- $999 matches. One value off by $50.  
- Given criterion of approximate semantics, $1099 vs $1149 is close but not the same.  
- However, these are prices, and a $50 difference is significant, probably indicating different pricing tiers.

- $1299 is closer than $1399, but not exact.  
- Under criterion of approximate semantics, is this close enough? It's a $100 difference.

- Given criterion of approximate semantics, $1099 vs $1149 is close but not the same.

- $1299 is closer than $1399, but not exact.  
- Under criterion of approximate semantics, is this close enough? It's a $100 difference.  
- Possibly acceptable as approximate.

- Given criterion of approximate semantics, $1099 vs $1149 is close but not the same.

**idx_0**  
- Response: ""firstmulti-touchscreen""  
- Target: ""revolutionarymodelwithtouchscreendesign""  
- Analysis: The response highlights ""first multi-touch screen,"" the target mentions ""revolutionary model with touchscreen design."" Both indicate touchscreen innovation. The semantics roughly match, and ""first multi-touch"" is a legitimate specification of the revolutionary touchscreen design.  
- Score: 1

---

**idx_1**  
- Response: ""improvedbatterylife""  
- Target: ""supportfor3gnetwork,appstorelaunched""  
- Analysis: Response mentions ""improved battery life,"" but target speaks about ""3G network support"" and ""app store launched,"" which are different features. They do not point to the same entity or feature.  
- Score: 0

---

**idx_2**  
- Response: ""retinadisplay""  
- Target: ""retinadisplay,firstledflash""  
- Analysis: Response matches part of the target (retina display). Missing ""first LED flash,"" but per instructions, approximate semantics is sufficient as long as the main entity is matched.  
- Score: 1

---

**idx_3**  
- Response: ""siripersonalassistant""  
- Target: ""introductionofsirivoiceassistant""  
- Analysis: Both refer to Siri voice assistant. Semantics match well.

**idx_4**  
- Response: ""largerscreen/ltesupport""  
- Target: ""newlightningconnector,firstuseofnano-sim""

- Score: 0

---

**idx_6**  
- Response: ""largerscreens/forcetouch""  
- Target: ""firstsupportfornfcandapplepay""  
- Analysis: Response describes screen size and Force Touch; target talks about NFC and Apple Pay. Different features.  
- Score: 0

---

**idx_7**  
- Response: ""improvedperformance""  
- Target: ""introductionof3dtouchtechnology""  
- Analysis: ""Improved performance"" is generic; target is specifically about 3D Touch technology. Different features, no direct match, although ""improved"" could be loosely related, it's not the same entity.  
- Score: 0

---

**idx_8**  
- Response: ""wateranddustresistant""  
- Target: ""removed3.5mmheadphonejack,ip67wateranddustresistance""  
- Analysis: Response includes the key term ""water and dust resistant"" which is specifically mentioned as IP67 rating in target. Partial match, but since the response captures the water and dust resistance exactly, this is acceptable.  
- Score: 1

- Analysis: Different features.  
- Score: 0

---

**idx_14**  
- Response: ""triplecamerasystem""  
- Target: ""ultra-widecameraandu2chipforuwb""  
- Analysis: Response implies multiple cameras, target mentions ultra-wide camera. Could be accepted because triple camera system includes ultra-wide.  
- According to criterion, semantics approximately the same or pointing to the same entity are sufficient.  
- Accept triple camera system as roughly the same as ultra-wide camera (because ultra-wide is part of triple camera system).

- Criterion: It is sufficient if the semantics are approximately the same as the reference answer or if they point to the same entity. No need word-for-word match.

**idx_0:**  
Response: $499  
Target: $499/$599  
- Response gives one of the two listed prices, $499.  
- Semantically close, the response mentions a value included in the target range.

**idx_3:**  
Response: $199/$299  
Target: $199/$299/$399  
- Response includes two of the three prices in the target.  
- Missing $399 but still mostly correct.  
Score: 1

---

**idx_4:**  
Response: $199/$269  
Target: $199/$299/$399  
- $269 is not in the target; response is partially inaccurate.  
- $199 matches, but $269 vs $299 is different enough to be considered incorrect.  
- Since criterion asks for approximate semantics and pointing to the same entity, this may not be sufficient because $269 ≠ $299.  
Score: 0

**idx_7:**  
Response: $199/$279  
Target: $199/$299/$399  
- $279 ≠ $299, so partial mismatch

**idx_11:**  
Response: $749/$849  
Target: $749/$799/$899  
- Response matches two of the target prices, missing $799 only.  
- Approximate semantics: close, missing one middling price.  
Score: 1

---

**idx_12:**  
Response: $999/$1149  
Target: $999/$1149/$1349  
- Two of three prices matched.  
- Acceptable under criterion.  
Score: 1

**idx_13:**  
Response: $399/$449  
Target: $699/$749/$849  
- No overlap, prices quite different, no semantic equivalence.  
Score: 0

---

**idx_14:**  
Response: $999/$1099  
Target: $999/$1149/$1349  
- $1099 (response) vs $1149 (target), close but different values.  
- $999 matches. One value off by $50.  
- Given criterion of approximate semantics, $1099 vs $1149 is close but not the same.  
- However, these are prices, and a $50 difference is significant, probably indicating different pricing tiers.  
- Thus, treat this as incorrect.  
Score: 0

---

**idx_15:**  
Response: $799/$899  
Target: $799/$849/$949  
- Response matches $799 only exactly. $899 vs $849 and $949 different numbers.  
- However, two price points are off by $50 each.  
- Not sufficiently close.  
Score: 0

---

**idx_16:**  
Response: $799/$999  
Target: $799/$899/$1099  
- $799 matches; $999 does not match $899 or $1099 but is somewhat close.  
- Given $100 difference, probably distinct price tiers.  
- Not sufficiently close.  
Score: 0

**idx_19:**  
Response: $1199/$1299  
Target: $1199/$1399/$1599  
- $1199 matches.  
- $1299 vs $1399 close but different.  
- $1299 is closer than $1399, but not exact.  
- Under criterion of approximate semantics, is this close enough? It's a $100 difference.  
- Possibly acceptable as approximate.  
- However, since we judged $1099 vs $1149 as incorrect earlier, this is similar. For consistency, treat this as incorrect.
