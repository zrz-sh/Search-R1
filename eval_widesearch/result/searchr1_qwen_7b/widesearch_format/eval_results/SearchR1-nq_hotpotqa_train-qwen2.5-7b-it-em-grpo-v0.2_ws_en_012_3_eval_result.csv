Criterion summary: 
- It is sufficient if the response points to the same university as the reference answer.
- Semantic equivalence suffices; no need for exact wording or matching supplementary info.
- Since all responses have 'nan' as response, i.e., no answer provided, but the targets are non-null for most except idx_6, idx_7, idx_12, and idx_15 where target is also 'nan'.

Step-by-step analysis:

idx_0: response='nan', target='georgewashingtonuniversity'  
- Target expects a university name  
- Response is 'nan', no answer at all => no match => score 0

idx_1: response='nan', target='cavitestateuniversity'  
- Same as above => no answer => score 0

idx_2: response='nan', target='stjoseph’sconventschool'  
- Target expects a school name  
- Response empty => score 0

idx_3: response='nan', target='santabarbaracitycollege'  
- Response empty => score 0

idx_4: response='nan', target='st.xavier’scollege(socialwork)'  
- Response empty => score 0

idx_5: response='nan', target='blackhawkcollege(att.)'  
- Response empty => score 0

idx_6: response='nan', target='nan'  
- Target is 'nan' meaning no expected answer or no data?  
- Response is also 'nan'. So no answer needed or no answer given. Depending on interpretation, since no target is given, response is also empty.  
- Possibly we consider this correct because both are 'nan' (no info) or no answer expected?  
- The criterion does not explicitly mention this scenario, but logically: if no target, then response empty should be acceptable.  
- So score 1

idx_7: response='nan', target='nan'  
- Same as idx_6 => score 1

idx_8: response='nan', target='universidadsantiagodecali(law)'

Criterion summary: 
- It is sufficient if the response points to the same university as the reference answer.
- Semantic equivalence suffices; no need for exact wording or matching supplementary info.
- Since all responses have 'nan' as response, i.e., no answer provided, but the targets are non-null for most except idx_6, idx_7, idx_12, and idx_15 where target is also 'nan'.

Step-by-step analysis:

idx_0: response='nan', target='georgewashingtonuniversity'  
- Target expects a university name  
- Response is 'nan', no answer at all => no match => score 0

idx_1: response='nan', target='cavitestateuniversity'  
- Same as above => no answer => score 0

idx_2: response='nan', target='stjoseph’sconventschool'

- Response empty => score 0

idx_5: response='nan', target='blackhawkcollege(att.)'  
- Response empty => score 0

idx_6: response='nan', target='nan'  
- Target is 'nan' meaning no expected answer or no data?  
- Response is also 'nan'. So no answer needed or no answer given. Depending on interpretation, since no target is given, response is also empty.  
- Possibly we consider this correct because both are 'nan' (no info) or no answer expected?  
- The criterion does not explicitly mention this scenario, but logically: if no target, then response empty should be acceptable.  
- So score 1

idx_7: response='nan', target='nan'  
- Same as idx_6 => score 1

idx_8: response='nan', target='universidadsantiagodecali(law)'

Criterion summary: 
- It is sufficient if the response points to the same university as the reference answer.
- Semantic equivalence suffices; no need for exact wording or matching supplementary info.
- Since all responses have 'nan' as response, i.e., no answer provided, but the targets are non-null for most except idx_6, idx_7, idx_12, and idx_15 where target is also 'nan'.

Step-by-step analysis:

idx_0: response='nan', target='georgewashingtonuniversity'  
- Target expects a university name  
- Response is 'nan', no answer at all => no match => score 0

idx_1: response='nan', target='cavitestateuniversity'  
- Same as above => no answer => score 0

idx_2: response='nan', target='stjoseph’sconventschool'  
- Target expects a school name  
- Response empty => score 0

idx_3: response='nan', target='santabarbaracitycollege'  
- Response empty => score 0

idx_4: response='nan', target='st.xavier’scollege(socialwork)'  
- Response empty => score 0

idx_5: response='nan', target='blackhawkcollege(att.)'  
- Response empty => score 0

idx_6: response='nan', target='nan'  
- Target is 'nan' meaning no expected answer or no data?  
- Response is also 'nan'. So no answer needed or no answer given. Depending on interpretation, since no target is given, response is also empty.  
- Possibly we consider this correct because both are 'nan' (no info) or no answer expected?  
- The criterion does not explicitly mention this scenario, but logically: if no target, then response empty should be acceptable.  
- So score 1

idx_7: response='nan', target='nan'  
- Same as idx_6 => score 1

idx_8: response='nan', target='universidadsantiagodecali(law)'  
- Response empty => score 0

idx_9: response='nan', target='universityofcincinnati(music)'

Criterion summary: 
- It is sufficient if the response points to the same university as the reference answer.
- Semantic equivalence suffices; no need for exact wording or matching supplementary info.
- Since all responses have 'nan' as response, i.e., no answer provided, but the targets are non-null for most except idx_6, idx_7, idx_12, and idx_15 where target is also 'nan'.

Step-by-step analysis:

idx_0: response='nan', target='georgewashingtonuniversity'  
- Target expects a university name  
- Response is 'nan', no answer at all => no match => score 0

idx_1: response='nan', target='cavitestateuniversity'  
- Same as above => no answer => score 0

idx_2: response='nan', target='stjoseph’sconventschool'  
- Target expects a school name  
- Response empty => score 0

idx_3: response='nan', target='santabarbaracitycollege'  
- Response empty => score 0

idx_4: response='nan', target='st.xavier’scollege(socialwork)'  
- Response empty => score 0

idx_5: response='nan', target='blackhawkcollege(att.)'  
- Response empty => score 0

idx_6: response='nan', target='nan'  
- Target is 'nan' meaning no expected answer or no data?  
- Response is also 'nan'. So no answer needed or no answer given. Depending on interpretation, since no target is given, response is also empty.  
- Possibly we consider this correct because both are 'nan' (no info) or no answer expected?  
- The criterion does not explicitly mention this scenario, but logically: if no target, then response empty should be acceptable.  
- So score 1

idx_7: response='nan', target='nan'  
- Same as idx_6 => score 1

idx_8: response='nan', target='universidadsantiagodecali(law)'  
- Response empty => score 0

idx_9: response='nan', target='universityofcincinnati(music)'  
- Response empty => score 0

idx_10: response='nan', target='universidadautónomadeguadalajara(md)'

```",supportschildrenlivingwithincarceratedparents,supportschildrensotheydon'thavetolivebehindbarswiththeirincarceratedparents.,0.0,"Let's analyze each idx based on the criterion:

Criterion summary: 
- It is sufficient if the response points to the same university as the reference answer.
- Semantic equivalence suffices; no need for exact wording or matching supplementary info.
- Since all responses have 'nan' as response, i.e., no answer provided, but the targets are non-null for most except idx_6, idx_7, idx_12, and idx_15 where target is also 'nan'.

Step-by-step analysis:

idx_0: response='nan', target='georgewashingtonuniversity'  
- Target expects a university name  
- Response is 'nan', no answer at all => no match => score 0

idx_1: response='nan', target='cavitestateuniversity'  
- Same as above => no answer => score 0

idx_2: response='nan', target='stjoseph’sconventschool'  
- Target expects a school name  
- Response empty => score 0

idx_3: response='nan', target='santabarbaracitycollege'  
- Response empty => score 0

idx_4: response='nan', target='st.xavier’scollege(socialwork)'  
- Response empty => score 0

idx_5: response='nan', target='blackhawkcollege(att.)'  
- Response empty => score 0

idx_6: response='nan', target='nan'  
- Target is 'nan' meaning no expected answer or no data?  
- Response is also 'nan'. So no answer needed or no answer given. Depending on interpretation, since no target is given, response is also empty.  
- Possibly we consider this correct because both are 'nan' (no info) or no answer expected?  
- The criterion does not explicitly mention this scenario, but logically: if no target, then response empty should be acceptable.  
- So score 1

idx_7: response='nan', target='nan'  
- Same as idx_6 => score 1

idx_8: response='nan', target='universidadsantiagodecali(law)'  
- Response empty => score 0

idx_9: response='nan', target='universityofcincinnati(music)'  
- Response empty => score 0

idx_10: response='nan', target='universidadautónomadeguadalajara(md)'

Criterion summary: 
- It is sufficient if the response points to the same university as the reference answer.
- Semantic equivalence suffices; no need for exact wording or matching supplementary info.
- Since all responses have 'nan' as response, i.e., no answer provided, but the targets are non-null for most except idx_6, idx_7, idx_12, and idx_15 where target is also 'nan'.

Step-by-step analysis:

idx_0: response='nan', target='georgewashingtonuniversity'  
- Target expects a university name  
- Response is 'nan', no answer at all => no match => score 0

idx_1: response='nan', target='cavitestateuniversity'  
- Same as above => no answer => score 0

idx_2: response='nan', target='stjoseph’sconventschool'

idx_5: response='nan', target='blackhawkcollege(att.)'  
- Response empty => score 0

idx_6: response='nan', target='nan'  
- Target is 'nan' meaning no expected answer or no data?  
- Response is also 'nan'. So no answer needed or no answer given. Depending on interpretation, since no target is given, response is also empty.  
- Possibly we consider this correct because both are 'nan' (no info) or no answer expected?  
- The criterion does not explicitly mention this scenario, but logically: if no target, then response empty should be acceptable.  
- So score 1

idx_7: response='nan', target='nan'

```","kopilavalleychildren’shome,school&women’scenter",leadsaprogramthattrainshealthworkerstocombatmalaria.,1.0,"Let's analyze each idx based on the criterion:

Criterion summary: 
- It is sufficient if the response points to the same university as the reference answer.
- Semantic equivalence suffices; no need for exact wording or matching supplementary info.
- Since all responses have 'nan' as response, i.e., no answer provided, but the targets are non-null for most except idx_6, idx_7, idx_12, and idx_15 where target is also 'nan'.

Step-by-step analysis:

idx_0: response='nan', target='georgewashingtonuniversity'  
- Target expects a university name  
- Response is 'nan', no answer at all => no match => score 0

idx_1: response='nan', target='cavitestateuniversity'  
- Same as above => no answer => score 0

idx_2: response='nan', target='stjoseph’sconventschool'  
- Target expects a school name  
- Response empty => score 0

idx_3: response='nan', target='santabarbaracitycollege'  
- Response empty => score 0

idx_4: response='nan', target='st.xavier’scollege(socialwork)'  
- Response empty => score 0

idx_5: response='nan', target='blackhawkcollege(att.)'  
- Response empty => score 0

idx_6: response='nan', target='nan'  
- Target is 'nan' meaning no expected answer or no data?  
- Response is also 'nan'. So no answer needed or no answer given. Depending on interpretation, since no target is given, response is also empty.  
- Possibly we consider this correct because both are 'nan' (no info) or no answer expected?  
- The criterion does not explicitly mention this scenario, but logically: if no target, then response empty should be acceptable.  
- So score 1

idx_7: response='nan', target='nan'  
- Same as idx_6 => score 1

idx_8: response='nan', target='universidadsantiagodecali(law)'  
- Response empty => score 0

Criterion summary: 
- It is sufficient if the response points to the same university as the reference answer.
- Semantic equivalence suffices; no need for exact wording or matching supplementary info.
- Since all responses have 'nan' as response, i.e., no answer provided, but the targets are non-null for most except idx_6, idx_7, idx_12, and idx_15 where target is also 'nan'.

Step-by-step analysis:

idx_0: response='nan', target='georgewashingtonuniversity'  
- Target expects a university name  
- Response is 'nan', no answer at all => no match => score 0

idx_1: response='nan', target='cavitestateuniversity'  
- Same as above => no answer => score 0

idx_2: response='nan', target='stjoseph’sconventschool'  
- Target expects a school name  
- Response empty => score 0

idx_3: response='nan', target='santabarbaracitycollege'

idx_4: response='nan', target='st.xavier’scollege(socialwork)'  
- Response empty => score 0

idx_5: response='nan', target='blackhawkcollege(att.)'  
- Response empty => score 0

idx_6: response='nan', target='nan'  
- Target is 'nan' meaning no expected answer or no data?  
- Response is also 'nan'. So no answer needed or no answer given. Depending on interpretation, since no target is given, response is also empty.  
- Possibly we consider this correct because both are 'nan' (no info) or no answer expected?  
- The criterion does not explicitly mention this scenario, but logically: if no target, then response empty should be acceptable.  
- So score 1

idx_7: response='nan', target='nan'  
- Same as idx_6 => score 1

idx_8: response='nan', target='universidadsantiagodecali(law)'

Criterion summary: 
- It is sufficient if the response points to the same university as the reference answer.
- Semantic equivalence suffices; no need for exact wording or matching supplementary info.
- Since all responses have 'nan' as response, i.e., no answer provided, but the targets are non-null for most except idx_6, idx_7, idx_12, and idx_15 where target is also 'nan'.

Step-by-step analysis:

idx_0: response='nan', target='georgewashingtonuniversity'  
- Target expects a university name  
- Response is 'nan', no answer at all => no match => score 0

idx_1: response='nan', target='cavitestateuniversity'  
- Same as above => no answer => score 0

idx_2: response='nan', target='stjoseph’sconventschool'  
- Target expects a school name  
- Response empty => score 0

idx_3: response='nan', target='santabarbaracitycollege'  
- Response empty => score 0

idx_4: response='nan', target='st.xavier’scollege(socialwork)'  
- Response empty => score 0

idx_5: response='nan', target='blackhawkcollege(att.)'  
- Response empty => score 0

idx_6: response='nan', target='nan'  
- Target is 'nan' meaning no expected answer or no data?  
- Response is also 'nan'. So no answer needed or no answer given. Depending on interpretation, since no target is given, response is also empty.  
- Possibly we consider this correct because both are 'nan' (no info) or no answer expected?  
- The criterion does not explicitly mention this scenario, but logically: if no target, then response empty should be acceptable.  
- So score 1

idx_7: response='nan', target='nan'  
- Same as idx_6 => score 1

idx_8: response='nan', target='universidadsantiagodecali(law)'  
- Response empty => score 0

idx_9: response='nan', target='universityofcincinnati(music)'  
- Response empty => score 0

idx_10: response='nan', target='universidadautónomadeguadalajara(md)'

idx_11: response='nan', target='prairieviewa&muniversity\n(chemicalengineering)'

```","freehousing,food&careforsickchildren&families",continuestoprovidehealthcareservicestounderservedpopulationsinruralareas.,0.0,"Let's analyze each idx based on the criterion:

Criterion summary: 
- It is sufficient if the response points to the same university as the reference answer.
- Semantic equivalence suffices; no need for exact wording or matching supplementary info.
- Since all responses have 'nan' as response, i.e., no answer provided, but the targets are non-null for most except idx_6, idx_7, idx_12, and idx_15 where target is also 'nan'.

Step-by-step analysis:

idx_0: response='nan', target='georgewashingtonuniversity'  
- Target expects a university name  
- Response is 'nan', no answer at all => no match => score 0

idx_1: response='nan', target='cavitestateuniversity'  
- Same as above => no answer => score 0

idx_2: response='nan', target='stjoseph’sconventschool'  
- Target expects a school name  
- Response empty => score 0

idx_3: response='nan', target='santabarbaracitycollege'  
- Response empty => score 0

idx_4: response='nan', target='st.xavier’scollege(socialwork)'  
- Response empty => score 0

idx_5: response='nan', target='blackhawkcollege(att.)'  
- Response empty => score 0

idx_6: response='nan', target='nan'  
- Target is 'nan' meaning no expected answer or no data?  
- Response is also 'nan'. So no answer needed or no answer given. Depending on interpretation, since no target is given, response is also empty.  
- Possibly we consider this correct because both are 'nan' (no info) or no answer expected?  
- The criterion does not explicitly mention this scenario, but logically: if no target, then response empty should be acceptable.  
- So score 1

idx_7: response='nan', target='nan'  
- Same as idx_6 => score 1

idx_8: response='nan', target='universidadsantiagodecali(law)'  
- Response empty => score 0

idx_9: response='nan', target='universityofcincinnati(music)'  
- Response empty => score 0

idx_10: response='nan', target='universidadautónomadeguadalajara(md)'

```",reusablemenstrualpads&menstrual-healtheducation(dignityperiod),continuestoprovidehealthcareservicestounderservedpopulationsinruralareas.,0.0,"Let's analyze each idx based on the criterion:

Criterion summary: 
- It is sufficient if the response points to the same university as the reference answer.
- Semantic equivalence suffices; no need for exact wording or matching supplementary info.
- Since all responses have 'nan' as response, i.e., no answer provided, but the targets are non-null for most except idx_6, idx_7, idx_12, and idx_15 where target is also 'nan'.

Step-by-step analysis:

idx_0: response='nan', target='georgewashingtonuniversity'  
- Target expects a university name  
- Response is 'nan', no answer at all => no match => score 0

idx_1: response='nan', target='cavitestateuniversity'  
- Same as above => no answer => score 0

idx_2: response='nan', target='stjoseph’sconventschool'  
- Target expects a school name  
- Response empty => score 0

idx_3: response='nan', target='santabarbaracitycollege'  
- Response empty => score 0

idx_4: response='nan', target='st.xavier’scollege(socialwork)'  
- Response empty => score 0

idx_5: response='nan', target='blackhawkcollege(att.)'  
- Response empty => score 0

idx_6: response='nan', target='nan'  
- Target is 'nan' meaning no expected answer or no data?  
- Response is also 'nan'. So no answer needed or no answer given. Depending on interpretation, since no target is given, response is also empty.  
- Possibly we consider this correct because both are 'nan' (no info) or no answer expected?  
- The criterion does not explicitly mention this scenario, but logically: if no target, then response empty should be acceptable.  
- So score 1

idx_7: response='nan', target='nan'  
- Same as idx_6 => score 1

idx_8: response='nan', target='universidadsantiagodecali(law)'  
- Response empty => score 0

idx_9: response='nan', target='universityofcincinnati(music)'  
- Response empty => score 0

```","beauty,hygiene,food&advocacyforunhousedpeople",continuestoprovidehealthcareservicestounderservedpopulationsinruralareas.,1.0,"Let's analyze each idx based on the criterion:

Criterion summary: 
- It is sufficient if the response points to the same university as the reference answer.
- Semantic equivalence suffices; no need for exact wording or matching supplementary info.
- Since all responses have 'nan' as response, i.e., no answer provided, but the targets are non-null for most except idx_6, idx_7, idx_12, and idx_15 where target is also 'nan'.

Step-by-step analysis:

idx_0: response='nan', target='georgewashingtonuniversity'  
- Target expects a university name  
- Response is 'nan', no answer at all => no match => score 0

idx_1: response='nan', target='cavitestateuniversity'  
- Same as above => no answer => score 0

idx_2: response='nan', target='stjoseph’sconventschool'  
- Target expects a school name  
- Response empty => score 0

idx_3: response='nan', target='santabarbaracitycollege'  
- Response empty => score 0

idx_4: response='nan', target='st.xavier’scollege(socialwork)'  
- Response empty => score 0

idx_5: response='nan', target='blackhawkcollege(att.)'  
- Response empty => score 0

idx_6: response='nan', target='nan'  
- Target is 'nan' meaning no expected answer or no data?  
- Response is also 'nan'. So no answer needed or no answer given. Depending on interpretation, since no target is given, response is also empty.  
- Possibly we consider this correct because both are 'nan' (no info) or no answer expected?  
- The criterion does not explicitly mention this scenario, but logically: if no target, then response empty should be acceptable.  
- So score 1

idx_7: response='nan', target='nan'  
- Same as idx_6 => score 1

idx_8: response='nan', target='universidadsantiagodecali(law)'  
- Response empty => score 0

idx_9: response='nan', target='universityofcincinnati(music)'  
- Response empty => score 0

idx_10: response='nan', target='universidadautónomadeguadalajara(md)'

idx_11: response='nan', target='prairieviewa&muniversity\n(chemicalengineering)'

idx_12: response='nan', target='nan'  
- Both nan => score 1

Criterion summary: 
- It is sufficient if the response points to the same university as the reference answer.
- Semantic equivalence suffices; no need for exact wording or matching supplementary info.
- Since all responses have 'nan' as response, i.e., no answer provided, but the targets are non-null for most except idx_6, idx_7, idx_12, and idx_15 where target is also 'nan'.

Step-by-step analysis:

idx_0: response='nan', target='georgewashingtonuniversity'  
- Target expects a university name  
- Response is 'nan', no answer at all => no match => score 0

idx_1: response='nan', target='cavitestateuniversity'  
- Same as above => no answer => score 0

idx_2: response='nan', target='stjoseph’sconventschool'  
- Target expects a school name  
- Response empty => score 0

idx_3: response='nan', target='santabarbaracitycollege'  
- Response empty => score 0

idx_4: response='nan', target='st.xavier’scollege(socialwork)'  
- Response empty => score 0

idx_5: response='nan', target='blackhawkcollege(att.)'  
- Response empty => score 0

idx_6: response='nan', target='nan'  
- Target is 'nan' meaning no expected answer or no data?  
- Response is also 'nan'. So no answer needed or no answer given. Depending on interpretation, since no target is given, response is also empty.  
- Possibly we consider this correct because both are 'nan' (no info) or no answer expected?  
- The criterion does not explicitly mention this scenario, but logically: if no target, then response empty should be acceptable.  
- So score 1

idx_7: response='nan', target='nan'  
- Same as idx_6 => score 1

idx_8: response='nan', target='universidadsantiagodecali(law)'  
- Response empty => score 0

idx_9: response='nan', target='universityofcincinnati(music)'

```",temporaryfostercareforpetswhileownersenteraddictiontreatment,nan,1.0,"Let's analyze each idx based on the criterion:

Criterion summary: 
- It is sufficient if the response points to the same university as the reference answer.
- Semantic equivalence suffices; no need for exact wording or matching supplementary info.
- Since all responses have 'nan' as response, i.e., no answer provided, but the targets are non-null for most except idx_6, idx_7, idx_12, and idx_15 where target is also 'nan'.

Step-by-step analysis:

idx_0: response='nan', target='georgewashingtonuniversity'  
- Target expects a university name  
- Response is 'nan', no answer at all => no match => score 0

idx_1: response='nan', target='cavitestateuniversity'  
- Same as above => no answer => score 0

idx_2: response='nan', target='stjoseph’sconventschool'  
- Target expects a school name  
- Response empty => score 0

idx_3: response='nan', target='santabarbaracitycollege'  
- Response empty => score 0

idx_4: response='nan', target='st.xavier’scollege(socialwork)'  
- Response empty => score 0

idx_5: response='nan', target='blackhawkcollege(att.)'  
- Response empty => score 0

idx_6: response='nan', target='nan'  
- Target is 'nan' meaning no expected answer or no data?  
- Response is also 'nan'. So no answer needed or no answer given. Depending on interpretation, since no target is given, response is also empty.  
- Possibly we consider this correct because both are 'nan' (no info) or no answer expected?  
- The criterion does not explicitly mention this scenario, but logically: if no target, then response empty should be acceptable.  
- So score 1

idx_7: response='nan', target='nan'  
- Same as idx_6 => score 1

idx_8: response='nan', target='universidadsantiagodecali(law)'  
- Response empty => score 0

idx_9: response='nan', target='universityofcincinnati(music)'  
- Response empty => score 0

idx_10: response='nan', target='universidadautónomadeguadalajara(md)'

idx_11: response='nan', target='prairieviewa&muniversity\n(chemicalengineering)'  
- Response empty => score 0

idx_12: response='nan', target='nan'  
- Both nan => score 1

idx_13: response='nan', target='augustanacollege(cs&appliedmath)'
