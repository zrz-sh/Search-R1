- It is sufficient if the semantics are approximately the same as the reference answer or if they point to the same entity.
- Word-for-word matching is not necessary.
- Matching one or more from the reference answer is sufficient.
- The response can have some content outside the reference and still be acceptable.

Here, the responses are all `""nan""` (string), whereas the target answers are specific names or lists of names.

Step-by-step:

- idx_0 to idx_19:  
  The response is always `""nan""`.  
  The target is always a name or a list of names (e.g., ""julianbunetta"", ""joekeery,adamthein"", etc.)  

Since `""nan""` is semantically unrelated to any of the named entities in the targets, none of these responses match the semantics or point to the same entity as the target. Therefore, all pairs score 0.

- Is ""gata"" equivalent to ""gataonly""? ""gataonly"" seems to be a full song title. ""gata"" looks like a partial title. Does the response refer exactly to the same entity?  
- According to criterion, main body consistency is acceptable; no need for ""feat"" or ""only"" but ""only"" at the end is significant?  
- ""gataonly"" is likely the full title, response misses ""only"". Still mentions the main body ""gata"".

### idx_3  
response: ""gata"" vs target: ""gataonly""  
- Is ""gata"" equivalent to ""gataonly""? ""gataonly"" seems to be a full song title. ""gata"" looks like a partial title. Does the response refer exactly to the same entity?  
- According to criterion, main body consistency is acceptable; no need for ""feat"" or ""only"" but ""only"" at the end is significant?  
- ""gataonly"" is likely the full title, response misses ""only"". Still mentions the main body ""gata"".  
- Since ""only"" looks like part of the title, and ""gata"" alone could be insufficient to identify the same song, but criterion says main body consistency is enough. The main body ""gata"" is consistent with ""gataonly"".

- The response can have some content outside the reference and still be acceptable.

Here, the responses are all `""nan""` (string), whereas the target answers are specific names or lists of names.

Step-by-step:

- idx_0 to idx_19:  
  The response is always `""nan""`.  
  The target is always a name or a list of names (e.g., ""julianbunetta"", ""joekeery,adamthein"", etc.)  

Since `""nan""` is semantically unrelated to any of the named entities in the targets, none of these responses match the semantics or point to the same entity as the target. Therefore, all pairs score 0.

- It is sufficient if the semantics are approximately the same as the reference answer or if they point to the same entity.
- Word-for-word matching is not necessary.
- Matching one or more from the reference answer is sufficient.
- The response can have some content outside the reference and still be acceptable.

Here, the responses are all `""nan""` (string), whereas the target answers are specific names or lists of names.

Step-by-step:

- idx_0 to idx_19:  
  The response is always `""nan""`.  
  The target is always a name or a list of names (e.g., ""julianbunetta"", ""joekeery,adamthein"", etc.)  

Since `""nan""` is semantically unrelated to any of the named entities in the targets, none of these responses match the semantics or point to the same entity as the target. Therefore, all pairs score 0.

- It is sufficient if the semantics are approximately the same as the reference answer or if they point to the same entity.
- Word-for-word matching is not necessary.
- Matching one or more from the reference answer is sufficient.
- The response can have some content outside the reference and still be acceptable.

Here, the responses are all `""nan""` (string), whereas the target answers are specific names or lists of names.

Step-by-step:

- idx_0 to idx_19:  
  The response is always `""nan""`.  
  The target is always a name or a list of names (e.g., ""julianbunetta"", ""joekeery,adamthein"", etc.)  

Since `""nan""` is semantically unrelated to any of the named entities in the targets, none of these responses match the semantics or point to the same entity as the target. Therefore, all pairs score 0.

response: ""gata"" vs target: ""gataonly""  
- Is ""gata"" equivalent to ""gataonly""? ""gataonly"" seems to be a full song title. ""gata"" looks like a partial title. Does the response refer exactly to the same entity?  
- According to criterion, main body consistency is acceptable; no need for ""feat"" or ""only"" but ""only"" at the end is significant?  
- ""gataonly"" is likely the full title, response misses ""only"". Still mentions the main body ""gata"".  
- Since ""only"" looks like part of the title, and ""gata"" alone could be insufficient to identify the same song, but criterion says main body consistency is enough. The main body ""gata"" is consistent with ""gataonly"".

- Is ""gata"" equivalent to ""gataonly""? ""gataonly"" seems to be a full song title. ""gata"" looks like a partial title. Does the response refer exactly to the same entity?  
- According to criterion, main body consistency is acceptable; no need for ""feat"" or ""only"" but ""only"" at the end is significant?  
- ""gataonly"" is likely the full title, response misses ""only"". Still mentions the main body ""gata"".

- The response can have some content outside the reference and still be acceptable.

Here, the responses are all `""nan""` (string), whereas the target answers are specific names or lists of names.

Step-by-step:

- idx_0 to idx_19:  
  The response is always `""nan""`.  
  The target is always a name or a list of names (e.g., ""julianbunetta"", ""joekeery,adamthein"", etc.)  

Since `""nan""` is semantically unrelated to any of the named entities in the targets, none of these responses match the semantics or point to the same entity as the target. Therefore, all pairs score 0.

- Is ""gata"" equivalent to ""gataonly""? ""gataonly"" seems to be a full song title. ""gata"" looks like a partial title. Does the response refer exactly to the same entity?  
- According to criterion, main body consistency is acceptable; no need for ""feat"" or ""only"" but ""only"" at the end is significant?  
- ""gataonly"" is likely the full title, response misses ""only"". Still mentions the main body ""gata"".  
- Since ""only"" looks like part of the title, and ""gata"" alone could be insufficient to identify the same song, but criterion says main body consistency is enough. The main body ""gata"" is consistent with ""gataonly"".

- The response can have some content outside the reference and still be acceptable.

Here, the responses are all `""nan""` (string), whereas the target answers are specific names or lists of names.

Step-by-step:

- idx_0 to idx_19:  
  The response is always `""nan""`.  
  The target is always a name or a list of names (e.g., ""julianbunetta"", ""joekeery,adamthein"", etc.)  

Since `""nan""` is semantically unrelated to any of the named entities in the targets, none of these responses match the semantics or point to the same entity as the target. Therefore, all pairs score 0.

  The response is always `""nan""`.  
  The target is always a name or a list of names (e.g., ""julianbunetta"", ""joekeery,adamthein"", etc.)  

Since `""nan""` is semantically unrelated to any of the named entities in the targets, none of these responses match the semantics or point to the same entity as the target. Therefore, all pairs score 0.

- Is ""gata"" equivalent to ""gataonly""? ""gataonly"" seems to be a full song title. ""gata"" looks like a partial title. Does the response refer exactly to the same entity?  
- According to criterion, main body consistency is acceptable; no need for ""feat"" or ""only"" but ""only"" at the end is significant?  
- ""gataonly"" is likely the full title, response misses ""only"". Still mentions the main body ""gata"".

- It is sufficient if the semantics are approximately the same as the reference answer or if they point to the same entity.
- Word-for-word matching is not necessary.
- Matching one or more from the reference answer is sufficient.
- The response can have some content outside the reference and still be acceptable.

Here, the responses are all `""nan""` (string), whereas the target answers are specific names or lists of names.

Step-by-step:

- idx_0 to idx_19:  
  The response is always `""nan""`.  
  The target is always a name or a list of names (e.g., ""julianbunetta"", ""joekeery,adamthein"", etc.)  

Since `""nan""` is semantically unrelated to any of the named entities in the targets, none of these responses match the semantics or point to the same entity as the target. Therefore, all pairs score 0.

- Is ""gata"" equivalent to ""gataonly""? ""gataonly"" seems to be a full song title. ""gata"" looks like a partial title. Does the response refer exactly to the same entity?  
- According to criterion, main body consistency is acceptable; no need for ""feat"" or ""only"" but ""only"" at the end is significant?  
- ""gataonly"" is likely the full title, response misses ""only"". Still mentions the main body ""gata"".

- It is sufficient if the semantics are approximately the same as the reference answer or if they point to the same entity.
- Word-for-word matching is not necessary.
- Matching one or more from the reference answer is sufficient.
- The response can have some content outside the reference and still be acceptable.

Here, the responses are all `""nan""` (string), whereas the target answers are specific names or lists of names.

Step-by-step:

- idx_0 to idx_19:  
  The response is always `""nan""`.  
  The target is always a name or a list of names (e.g., ""julianbunetta"", ""joekeery,adamthein"", etc.)  

Since `""nan""` is semantically unrelated to any of the named entities in the targets, none of these responses match the semantics or point to the same entity as the target. Therefore, all pairs score 0.

- It is sufficient if the semantics are approximately the same as the reference answer or if they point to the same entity.
- Word-for-word matching is not necessary.
- Matching one or more from the reference answer is sufficient.
- The response can have some content outside the reference and still be acceptable.

Here, the responses are all `""nan""` (string), whereas the target answers are specific names or lists of names.

Step-by-step:

- idx_0 to idx_19:  
  The response is always `""nan""`.  
  The target is always a name or a list of names (e.g., ""julianbunetta"", ""joekeery,adamthein"", etc.)  

Since `""nan""` is semantically unrelated to any of the named entities in the targets, none of these responses match the semantics or point to the same entity as the target. Therefore, all pairs score 0.

### idx_3  
response: ""gata"" vs target: ""gataonly""  
- Is ""gata"" equivalent to ""gataonly""? ""gataonly"" seems to be a full song title. ""gata"" looks like a partial title. Does the response refer exactly to the same entity?  
- According to criterion, main body consistency is acceptable; no need for ""feat"" or ""only"" but ""only"" at the end is significant?  
- ""gataonly"" is likely the full title, response misses ""only"". Still mentions the main body ""gata"".  
- Since ""only"" looks like part of the title, and ""gata"" alone could be insufficient to identify the same song, but criterion says main body consistency is enough. The main body ""gata"" is consistent with ""gataonly"".

- It is sufficient if the semantics are approximately the same as the reference answer or if they point to the same entity.
- Word-for-word matching is not necessary.
- Matching one or more from the reference answer is sufficient.
- The response can have some content outside the reference and still be acceptable.

Here, the responses are all `""nan""` (string), whereas the target answers are specific names or lists of names.

Step-by-step:

- idx_0 to idx_19:  
  The response is always `""nan""`.  
  The target is always a name or a list of names (e.g., ""julianbunetta"", ""joekeery,adamthein"", etc.)  

Since `""nan""` is semantically unrelated to any of the named entities in the targets, none of these responses match the semantics or point to the same entity as the target. Therefore, all pairs score 0.

response: ""espresso"" vs target: ""espresso""  
- Exact match.  
- Score: 1

### idx_1  
response: ""beautifulthings"" vs target: ""beautifulthings""  
- Exact match.  
- Score: 1

### idx_2  
response: ""birdsofafeather"" vs target: ""birdsofafeather""  
- Exact match.  
- Score: 1

### idx_3  
response: ""gata"" vs target: ""gataonly""  
- Is ""gata"" equivalent to ""gataonly""? ""gataonly"" seems to be a full song title. ""gata"" looks like a partial title. Does the response refer exactly to the same entity?  
- According to criterion, main body consistency is acceptable; no need for ""feat"" or ""only"" but ""only"" at the end is significant?  
- ""gataonly"" is likely the full title, response misses ""only"". Still mentions the main body ""gata"".  
- Since ""only"" looks like part of the title, and ""gata"" alone could be insufficient to identify the same song, but criterion says main body consistency is enough. The main body ""gata"" is consistent with ""gataonly"".  
- Score: 1

### idx_4  
response: ""nan"" vs target: ""losecontrol""  
- ""nan"" means no answer or empty, whereas target is ""losecontrol"". So does not match.  
- Score: 0

- It is sufficient if the semantics are approximately the same as the reference answer or if they point to the same entity.
- Word-for-word matching is not necessary.
- Matching one or more from the reference answer is sufficient.
- The response can have some content outside the reference and still be acceptable.

Here, the responses are all `""nan""` (string), whereas the target answers are specific names or lists of names.

Step-by-step:

- idx_0 to idx_19:  
  The response is always `""nan""`.  
  The target is always a name or a list of names (e.g., ""julianbunetta"", ""joekeery,adamthein"", etc.)  

Since `""nan""` is semantically unrelated to any of the named entities in the targets, none of these responses match the semantics or point to the same entity as the target. Therefore, all pairs score 0.

- Is ""gata"" equivalent to ""gataonly""? ""gataonly"" seems to be a full song title. ""gata"" looks like a partial title. Does the response refer exactly to the same entity?  
- According to criterion, main body consistency is acceptable; no need for ""feat"" or ""only"" but ""only"" at the end is significant?

- It is sufficient if the semantics are approximately the same as the reference answer or if they point to the same entity.
- Word-for-word matching is not necessary.
- Matching one or more from the reference answer is sufficient.
- The response can have some content outside the reference and still be acceptable.

Here, the responses are all `""nan""` (string), whereas the target answers are specific names or lists of names.

Step-by-step:

- idx_0 to idx_19:  
  The response is always `""nan""`.  
  The target is always a name or a list of names (e.g., ""julianbunetta"", ""joekeery,adamthein"", etc.)  

Since `""nan""` is semantically unrelated to any of the named entities in the targets, none of these responses match the semantics or point to the same entity as the target. Therefore, all pairs score 0.
