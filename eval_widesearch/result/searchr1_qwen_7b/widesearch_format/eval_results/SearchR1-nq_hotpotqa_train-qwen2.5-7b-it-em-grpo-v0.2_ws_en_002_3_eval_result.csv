chivasregal,Chivas Regal,,,12years,12 Years Old,1.0,"Let's analyze each item according to the criterion.

Criterion:  
- It is sufficient if the semantics are approximately the same or point to the same entity.  
- No need for word-for-word correspondence.  

---

### Item idx_0:
- Response: ""40""  
- Target: ""40.0%""  
- Analysis:  
  The response ""40"" represents the same numeric value as ""40.0%"" without the percent sign.  
  Since the percent sign merely contextualizes the number, and both refer to the value ""forty,"" the semantics are approximately the same and point to the same entity (the quantity 40%).  
  The criterion allows approximate equivalency without exact word match, so this is acceptable.

Score for idx_0: 1

---

### Item idx_1:
- Response: ""40""  
- Target: ""40.0%""  
- Analysis:  
  Same as for idx_0, the response ""40"" corresponds to the target ""40.0%"" in semantics.  
  The response represents the same numeric idea, thus fulfilling the criterion.

Score for idx_1: 1

- idx_0:
  - Target: ""whisky""
  - Response: ""blendedscotchwhisky""
  - Analysis: The response ""blendedscotchwhisky"" appears to be a concatenation of ""blended scotch whisky"", which is a type of whisky. According to the grading criterion, it is sufficient if the semantics are approximately the same or point to the same entity. Since ""blended scotch whisky"" is a specific kind of whisky, it qualifies as the same entity. Therefore, this response should be scored 1.

**Pair idx_0:**
- Target: ""750ml""
- Response: ""750ml""
- Analysis: The response exactly matches the target. Clearly correct.

**Pair idx_1:**
- Target: ""750ml""
- Response: ""700ml""
- Analysis: The response is a different capacity than the target; it does not approximately match nor indicate the same entity. According to the criterion, capacity does not need to match exactly if it is a regional variation (e.g., different regions have different standards). However, ""700ml"" is a common alternative wine bottle size but it is clearly different from ""750ml"". The criterion says it's sufficient if semantics approximately match or point to same entity. Here, the response points to a known wine bottle size but different from the target. Since ""700ml"" is a common but different standard, it might be acceptable as semantic approximation given the criterion about regional differences in wine capacity.

The criterion states: ""Different regions have wines of different specifications, so the capacity does not need to exactly match the reference answer."" This suggests that a response of ""700ml"" might still be accepted as correct since it refers to a similar entity (wine bottle size) and acknowledges regional variation.

Therefore, idx_1 can be scored as 1 as well.

**idx_0:**  
- Response: ""core/permanentrange""

Analysis:  
- ""core/permanentrange"" seems to be some label or category, not an entity referring to an alcoholic beverage.  
- Target is specific: ""blendedscotchwhisky"" (a type of whisky).  
- The response does not point to the same or a similar entity; it looks like a metadata/path string rather than a drink type or category.  
- Semantic match is not established here.  
- Therefore, score = 0
