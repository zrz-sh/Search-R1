Both are 'nan' (presumably no answer expected or given).

- target: 'nan'  
Same as above.  
Score = 1

---

**idx_2**  
- response: list of award names (5 items) separated by \n  
- target: 'nan'  
Response contains actual content, while target is 'nan'. This means target expects no answer or no data, but response gives some data. This is likely not matching.  
Score = 0

- target: very long list of multiple awards, many include 'bestanimatedfeature' or similar phrases.  
- The response matches semantically a main award category repeated in the list. Although response is very short, it points to the same main concept of best animated feature/film. Given the criterion that approximate semantics or pointing to the same entity is sufficient, this counts as correct.  
Score = 1

Response missing where target expects answer.  
Score = 0

---

**idx_8**  
- response: 'bestanimatedfilm'  
- target: '1.capri,hollywood-caprianimatedmovieoftheyearaward'  
Response points to a general category, whereas target is a specific award name. The criterion says approximate semantics or pointing to the same entity is sufficient, but the response does not mention the specific award and might not be considered the same entity. The target is a specific award name; the response is a category. Since the response is general and does not mention or match target entity, score = 0.

---

**idx_9**  
- response: 'bestanimatedfeature'  
- target: list of 10 awards, including kids' choice award, billboard music award, advanced imaging awards, Guinness world record award, etc. The response is a general category, target is a list of specific awards, many of which do not explicitly mention ""best animated feature"" as their name. Some do, some don't. The response general category ""bestanimatedfeature"" roughly corresponds to some of the target awards. According to the criterion, it's sufficient if semantics approximately the same or pointing to same entity. Since the response is generic and target is more diverse, it is not fully aligned but loosely connected. Still, the target contains a bestanimatedfeature award type, matching semantic approximate equivalence.

,,wreck-itralph,Wreck-It Ralph,0.0,"Let's analyze each idx one by one, comparing the response against the target, considering the criterion:  
""It is sufficient if the semantics are approximately the same or if they point to the same entity. No word-for-word correspondence needed.""

---

**idx_0**  
- response: 'nan'  
- target: 'nan'  
Both are 'nan' (presumably no answer expected or given).  
Score = 1 (matches as both null/no answer).

---

**idx_1**  
- response: 'nan'  
- target: 'nan'  
Same as above.  
Score = 1

---

**idx_2**  
- response: list of award names (5 items) separated by \n  
- target: 'nan'  
Response contains actual content, while target is 'nan'. This means target expects no answer or no data, but response gives some data. This is likely not matching.  
Score = 0

---

**idx_3**  
- response: 'nan'  
- target: list of 12 awards  
Response missing where target expects answer.  
Score = 0

---

**idx_4**  
- response: 'bestanimatedfeature'  
- target: very long list of multiple awards, many include 'bestanimatedfeature' or similar phrases.  
- The response matches semantically a main award category repeated in the list. Although response is very short, it points to the same main concept of best animated feature/film. Given the criterion that approximate semantics or pointing to the same entity is sufficient, this counts as correct.  
Score = 1

---

**idx_5**  
- response: 'nan'  
- target: list of 8 awards  
Response missing where target expects answer.  
Score = 0

---

**idx_6**  
- response: 'nan'  
- target: list of 25 awards  
Response missing where target expects answer.  
Score = 0

---

**idx_7**  
- response: 'nan'  
- target: list of 7 awards  
Response missing where target expects answer.  
Score = 0

---

**idx_8**  
- response: 'bestanimatedfilm'  
- target: '1.capri,hollywood-caprianimatedmovieoftheyearaward'  
Response points to a general category, whereas target is a specific award name. The criterion says approximate semantics or pointing to the same entity is sufficient, but the response does not mention the specific award and might not be considered the same entity. The target is a specific award name; the response is a category. Since the response is general and does not mention or match target entity, score = 0.

---

**idx_9**  
- response: 'bestanimatedfeature'  
- target: list of 10 awards, including kids' choice award, billboard music award, advanced imaging awards, Guinness world record award, etc. The response is a general category, target is a list of specific awards, many of which do not explicitly mention ""best animated feature"" as their name. Some do, some don't. The response general category ""bestanimatedfeature"" roughly corresponds to some of the target awards. According to the criterion, it's sufficient if semantics approximately the same or pointing to same entity. Since the response is generic and target is more diverse, it is not fully aligned but loosely connected. Still, the target contains a bestanimatedfeature award type, matching semantic approximate equivalence.  
Score = 1

---

**idx_10**  
- response: 'nan'  
- target: list of 4 awards  
Response missing answer.  
Score = 0

---

**idx_11**  
- response: 'bestanimatedfeature'  
- target: list of 18 awards all related to best animated feature or equivalent  
Response is just a short phrase that aligns with the general idea of the target list.  
By criterion, approximate semantics or pointing to the same entity is sufficient.  
Score = 1

---

**idx_12**  
- response: 'nan'  
- target: 'nan'  
Both null.  
Score = 1

---

**idx_13**  
- response: 'nan'  
- target: '1.reframe-feature'  
Response missing answer but target expects one award named ""reframe-feature"".  
""nan"" is no answer, so it does not match.  
Score = 0

**idx_2**  
- response: list of award names (5 items) separated by \n  
- target: 'nan'  
Response contains actual content, while target is 'nan'. This means target expects no answer or no data, but response gives some data. This is likely not matching.  
Score = 0

**idx_3**  
- response: 'nan'  
- target: list of 12 awards  
Response missing where target expects answer.  
Score = 0

---

**idx_4**  
- response: 'bestanimatedfeature'  
- target: very long list of multiple awards, many include 'bestanimatedfeature' or similar phrases.  
- The response matches semantically a main award category repeated in the list. Although response is very short, it points to the same main concept of best animated feature/film. Given the criterion that approximate semantics or pointing to the same entity is sufficient, this counts as correct.  
Score = 1

**idx_8**  
- response: 'bestanimatedfilm'

Response points to a general category, whereas target is a specific award name. The criterion says approximate semantics or pointing to the same entity is sufficient, but the response does not mention the specific award and might not be considered the same entity. The target is a specific award name; the response is a category. Since the response is general and does not mention or match target entity, score = 0.

---

**idx_9**  
- response: 'bestanimatedfeature'  
- target: list of 10 awards, including kids' choice award, billboard music award, advanced imaging awards, Guinness world record award, etc. The response is a general category, target is a list of specific awards, many of which do not explicitly mention ""best animated feature"" as their name. Some do, some don't. The response general category ""bestanimatedfeature"" roughly corresponds to some of the target awards. According to the criterion, it's sufficient if semantics approximately the same or pointing to same entity. Since the response is generic and target is more diverse, it is not fully aligned but loosely connected. Still, the target contains a bestanimatedfeature award type, matching semantic approximate equivalence.  
Score = 1

Response missing answer.

**idx_11**  
- response: 'bestanimatedfeature'  
- target: list of 18 awards all related to best animated feature or equivalent  
Response is just a short phrase that aligns with the general idea of the target list.  
By criterion, approximate semantics or pointing to the same entity is sufficient.  
Score = 1

- target: 'nan'  
Both null.  
Score = 1

**idx_13**

,,ralphbreakstheinternet,Ralph Breaks the Internet,0.0,"Let's analyze each idx one by one, comparing the response against the target, considering the criterion:  
""It is sufficient if the semantics are approximately the same or if they point to the same entity. No word-for-word correspondence needed.""

---

**idx_0**  
- response: 'nan'  
- target: 'nan'  
Both are 'nan' (presumably no answer expected or given).  
Score = 1 (matches as both null/no answer).

---

**idx_1**  
- response: 'nan'  
- target: 'nan'  
Same as above.  
Score = 1

---

**idx_2**  
- response: list of award names (5 items) separated by \n  
- target: 'nan'  
Response contains actual content, while target is 'nan'. This means target expects no answer or no data, but response gives some data. This is likely not matching.  
Score = 0

---

**idx_3**  
- response: 'nan'  
- target: list of 12 awards  
Response missing where target expects answer.  
Score = 0

---

**idx_4**  
- response: 'bestanimatedfeature'  
- target: very long list of multiple awards, many include 'bestanimatedfeature' or similar phrases.  
- The response matches semantically a main award category repeated in the list. Although response is very short, it points to the same main concept of best animated feature/film. Given the criterion that approximate semantics or pointing to the same entity is sufficient, this counts as correct.  
Score = 1

---

**idx_5**  
- response: 'nan'  
- target: list of 8 awards  
Response missing where target expects answer.  
Score = 0

---

**idx_6**  
- response: 'nan'  
- target: list of 25 awards  
Response missing where target expects answer.  
Score = 0

---

**idx_7**  
- response: 'nan'  
- target: list of 7 awards  
Response missing where target expects answer.  
Score = 0

---

**idx_8**  
- response: 'bestanimatedfilm'  
- target: '1.capri,hollywood-caprianimatedmovieoftheyearaward'  
Response points to a general category, whereas target is a specific award name. The criterion says approximate semantics or pointing to the same entity is sufficient, but the response does not mention the specific award and might not be considered the same entity. The target is a specific award name; the response is a category. Since the response is general and does not mention or match target entity, score = 0.

---

**idx_9**  
- response: 'bestanimatedfeature'  
- target: list of 10 awards, including kids' choice award, billboard music award, advanced imaging awards, Guinness world record award, etc. The response is a general category, target is a list of specific awards, many of which do not explicitly mention ""best animated feature"" as their name. Some do, some don't. The response general category ""bestanimatedfeature"" roughly corresponds to some of the target awards. According to the criterion, it's sufficient if semantics approximately the same or pointing to same entity. Since the response is generic and target is more diverse, it is not fully aligned but loosely connected. Still, the target contains a bestanimatedfeature award type, matching semantic approximate equivalence.  
Score = 1

---

**idx_10**  
- response: 'nan'  
- target: list of 4 awards  
Response missing answer.  
Score = 0

---

**idx_11**  
- response: 'bestanimatedfeature'  
- target: list of 18 awards all related to best animated feature or equivalent  
Response is just a short phrase that aligns with the general idea of the target list.  
By criterion, approximate semantics or pointing to the same entity is sufficient.  
Score = 1

---

**idx_12**  
- response: 'nan'  
- target: 'nan'  
Both null.  
Score = 1

---

**idx_13**  
- response: 'nan'  
- target: '1.reframe-feature'  
Response missing answer but target expects one award named ""reframe-feature"".  
""nan"" is no answer, so it does not match.  
Score = 0

---

**idx_14**  
- response: 'nan'  
- target: '1.reframe-feature'  
Same as idx_13.  
Score = 0

,,rayaandthelastdragon,Raya and the Last Dragon,0.0,"Let's analyze each idx one by one, comparing the response against the target, considering the criterion:  
""It is sufficient if the semantics are approximately the same or if they point to the same entity. No word-for-word correspondence needed.""

---

**idx_0**  
- response: 'nan'  
- target: 'nan'  
Both are 'nan' (presumably no answer expected or given).  
Score = 1 (matches as both null/no answer).

---

**idx_1**  
- response: 'nan'  
- target: 'nan'  
Same as above.  
Score = 1

---

**idx_2**  
- response: list of award names (5 items) separated by \n  
- target: 'nan'  
Response contains actual content, while target is 'nan'. This means target expects no answer or no data, but response gives some data. This is likely not matching.  
Score = 0

---

**idx_3**  
- response: 'nan'  
- target: list of 12 awards  
Response missing where target expects answer.  
Score = 0

---

**idx_4**  
- response: 'bestanimatedfeature'  
- target: very long list of multiple awards, many include 'bestanimatedfeature' or similar phrases.  
- The response matches semantically a main award category repeated in the list. Although response is very short, it points to the same main concept of best animated feature/film. Given the criterion that approximate semantics or pointing to the same entity is sufficient, this counts as correct.  
Score = 1

---

**idx_5**  
- response: 'nan'  
- target: list of 8 awards  
Response missing where target expects answer.  
Score = 0

---

**idx_6**  
- response: 'nan'  
- target: list of 25 awards  
Response missing where target expects answer.  
Score = 0

---

**idx_7**  
- response: 'nan'  
- target: list of 7 awards  
Response missing where target expects answer.  
Score = 0

---

**idx_8**  
- response: 'bestanimatedfilm'  
- target: '1.capri,hollywood-caprianimatedmovieoftheyearaward'  
Response points to a general category, whereas target is a specific award name. The criterion says approximate semantics or pointing to the same entity is sufficient, but the response does not mention the specific award and might not be considered the same entity. The target is a specific award name; the response is a category. Since the response is general and does not mention or match target entity, score = 0.

---

**idx_9**  
- response: 'bestanimatedfeature'  
- target: list of 10 awards, including kids' choice award, billboard music award, advanced imaging awards, Guinness world record award, etc. The response is a general category, target is a list of specific awards, many of which do not explicitly mention ""best animated feature"" as their name. Some do, some don't. The response general category ""bestanimatedfeature"" roughly corresponds to some of the target awards. According to the criterion, it's sufficient if semantics approximately the same or pointing to same entity. Since the response is generic and target is more diverse, it is not fully aligned but loosely connected. Still, the target contains a bestanimatedfeature award type, matching semantic approximate equivalence.  
Score = 1

---

**idx_10**  
- response: 'nan'  
- target: list of 4 awards  
Response missing answer.  
Score = 0

---

**idx_11**  
- response: 'bestanimatedfeature'  
- target: list of 18 awards all related to best animated feature or equivalent  
Response is just a short phrase that aligns with the general idea of the target list.  
By criterion, approximate semantics or pointing to the same entity is sufficient.  
Score = 1

---

**idx_12**  
- response: 'nan'  
- target: 'nan'  
Both null.  
Score = 1

---

**idx_13**  
- response: 'nan'  
- target: '1.reframe-feature'  
Response missing answer but target expects one award named ""reframe-feature"".  
""nan"" is no answer, so it does not match.  
Score = 0

---

**idx_14**  
- response: 'nan'

Same as idx_13.  
Score = 0

Some do, some don't. The response general category ""bestanimatedfeature"" roughly corresponds to some of the target awards. According to the criterion, it's sufficient if semantics approximately the same or pointing to same entity. Since the response is generic and target is more diverse, it is not fully aligned but loosely connected.
