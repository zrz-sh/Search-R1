**idx_0**

- Are these approximately the same or refer to the same entity?  
  - ""vver-1200"" is a specific type of nuclear reactor (a Russian pressurized water reactor design).  
  - ""phwrcandu6"" appears to be a code likely representing ""PHWR CANDU 6,"" which stands for Pressurized Heavy Water Reactor CANDU 6.

- Target: ""vver-440v-213""  
- Both are VVER designs (Russian pressurized water reactors), but different models: 1200 vs 440V-213.  
- Since they refer to the same general entity type (VVER reactors), but different specific models, are these approximately the same in semantics or pointing to the same entity?   
- The criterion says it is sufficient if semantics are approximately the same or point to the same entity. Since both are VVER reactors, they are closely related, arguably synonymous in category. However, the target specifies a specific variant ""440V-213"" which is distinct from ""1200"".  
- The question is whether referencing a different variant of the VVER is sufficient to give a point. Given the criterion is somewhat loose (""semantics are approximately the same""), we can consider them pointing to the same entity type ""VVER reactor"".  
- Hence, score = 1.

""It is sufficient if the semantics are approximately the same as the reference answer or if they point to the same entity.""

---

**idx_0**  
- Response: ""vver-1200""  
- Target: ""phwrcandu6""  
- Are these approximately the same or refer to the same entity?  
  - ""vver-1200"" is a specific type of nuclear reactor (a Russian pressurized water reactor design).  
  - ""phwrcandu6"" appears to be a code likely representing ""PHWR CANDU 6,"" which stands for Pressurized Heavy Water Reactor CANDU 6.  
  These are different types of nuclear reactors (PWR vs PHWR), so they do not point to the same entity. Therefore, score = 0.

---

**idx_1**  
- Response: ""vver-1200""  
- Target: ""vver-1200""  
- Exact match. Score = 1.

---

**idx_2**  
- Response: ""vver-1200""  
- Target: ""vver-440v-213""  
- Both are VVER designs (Russian pressurized water reactors), but different models: 1200 vs 440V-213.  
- Since they refer to the same general entity type (VVER reactors), but different specific models, are these approximately the same in semantics or pointing to the same entity?   
- The criterion says it is sufficient if semantics are approximately the same or point to the same entity. Since both are VVER reactors, they are closely related, arguably synonymous in category. However, the target specifies a specific variant ""440V-213"" which is distinct from ""1200"".  
- The question is whether referencing a different variant of the VVER is sufficient to give a point. Given the criterion is somewhat loose (""semantics are approximately the same""), we can consider them pointing to the same entity type ""VVER reactor"".  
- Hence, score = 1.

---

**idx_3**  
- Response: ""pwr""  
- Target: ""eprpwr""  
- ""eprpwr"" likely stands for ""EPR PWR"" (European Pressurized Reactor, a type of PWR).  
- ""pwr"" is Pressurized Water Reactor. ""eprpwr"" is a more specific variant of PWR. The response is less specific but still points to the same general entity.  
- The criterion says approximate semantics is sufficient. So ""pwr"" matches ""eprpwr"" well enough.  
- Score = 1.

---

**idx_4**  
- Response: ""pwr""  
- Target: ""eprpwr""  
- Same as idx_3.  
- Score = 1.
