Criterion:
- Focus only on whether hunting is prohibited or allowed.

- ""Limited hunting allowed"" must match target that hunting is allowed in some limited way, otherwise not.

However, strictly different PO boxes. Given criterion requires approx same semantics or same entity. Are these considered same entity? Probably not the same physical location. But as they are both PO boxes in the same city and zip, could be considered related. However, since criterion is about same entity, postal box number difference signals different entities.

- Target: ""pobox907,moabut84532""  
- Analysis: Same city and zip code (moab ut 84532), difference is only in the box number (627 vs 907). These might be different mailing addresses but still likely related entities. However, strictly different PO boxes. Given criterion requires approx same semantics or same entity. Are these considered same entity? Probably not the same physical location. But as they are both PO boxes in the same city and zip, could be considered related. However, since criterion is about same entity, postal box number difference signals different entities. So best to be conservative and score 0.

- Analysis: One is a PO box address in springdale UT (zip 84764) and the other is a physical street address in springdale, UT (zip 84767), both related to Zion National Park. This strongly indicates that although the format differs, both point to Zion National Park in Springdale, UT. The small zip code difference is common between PO boxes and physical addresses.

- Target: ""pobox907,moabut84532""  
- Analysis: Same city and zip code (moab ut 84532), difference is only in the box number (627 vs 907). These might be different mailing addresses but still likely related entities. However, strictly different PO boxes. Given criterion requires approx same semantics or same entity. Are these considered same entity? Probably not the same physical location. But as they are both PO boxes in the same city and zip, could be considered related. However, since criterion is about same entity, postal box number difference signals different entities. So best to be conservative and score 0.

- Analysis: One is a PO box address in springdale UT (zip 84764) and the other is a physical street address in springdale, UT (zip 84767), both related to Zion National Park. This strongly indicates that although the format differs, both point to Zion National Park in Springdale, UT. The small zip code difference is common between PO boxes and physical addresses.

Criterion:

Criterion:
- Focus only on whether hunting is prohibited or allowed.
- Responses that approximate the semantics or point to the same entity and correct overall regulation are sufficient.
- Permits required may imply allowed only with permit; if the target says prohibited but response says permits required, they contradict each other, unless target explicitly allows with permits.
- ""Limited hunting allowed"" must match target that hunting is allowed in some limited way, otherwise not.

**idx_3**

- Target: ""pobox907,moabut84532""  
- Analysis: Same city and zip code (moab ut 84532), difference is only in the box number (627 vs 907). These might be different mailing addresses but still likely related entities. However, strictly different PO boxes. Given criterion requires approx same semantics or same entity. Are these considered same entity? Probably not the same physical location. But as they are both PO boxes in the same city and zip, could be considered related. However, since criterion is about same entity, postal box number difference signals different entities. So best to be conservative and score 0.

- Analysis: One is a PO box address in springdale UT (zip 84764) and the other is a physical street address in springdale, UT (zip 84767), both related to Zion National Park. This strongly indicates that although the format differs, both point to Zion National Park in Springdale, UT. The small zip code difference is common between PO boxes and physical addresses.

**idx_3**

- Target: ""pobox907,moabut84532""  
- Analysis: Same city and zip code (moab ut 84532), difference is only in the box number (627 vs 907). These might be different mailing addresses but still likely related entities. However, strictly different PO boxes. Given criterion requires approx same semantics or same entity. Are these considered same entity? Probably not the same physical location. But as they are both PO boxes in the same city and zip, could be considered related. However, since criterion is about same entity, postal box number difference signals different entities. So best to be conservative and score 0.

- Analysis: One is a PO box address in springdale UT (zip 84764) and the other is a physical street address in springdale, UT (zip 84767), both related to Zion National Park. This strongly indicates that although the format differs, both point to Zion National Park in Springdale, UT. The small zip code difference is common between PO boxes and physical addresses.

- Analysis: Same city and zip code (moab ut 84532), difference is only in the box number (627 vs 907). These might be different mailing addresses but still likely related entities. However, strictly different PO boxes. Given criterion requires approx same semantics or same entity. Are these considered same entity? Probably not the same physical location. But as they are both PO boxes in the same city and zip, could be considered related. However, since criterion is about same entity, postal box number difference signals different entities. So best to be conservative and score 0.

Criterion:
- Focus only on whether hunting is prohibited or allowed.

Criterion:
- Focus only on whether hunting is prohibited or allowed.

- ""Limited hunting allowed"" must match target that hunting is allowed in some limited way, otherwise not.

- Target: ""pobox907,moabut84532""  
- Analysis: Same city and zip code (moab ut 84532), difference is only in the box number (627 vs 907). These might be different mailing addresses but still likely related entities. However, strictly different PO boxes. Given criterion requires approx same semantics or same entity. Are these considered same entity? Probably not the same physical location. But as they are both PO boxes in the same city and zip, could be considered related. However, since criterion is about same entity, postal box number difference signals different entities. So best to be conservative and score 0.

This strongly indicates that although the format differs, both point to Zion National Park in Springdale, UT. The small zip code difference is common between PO boxes and physical addresses.

Criterion:
- Focus only on whether hunting is prohibited or allowed.
- Responses that approximate the semantics or point to the same entity and correct overall regulation are sufficient.
- Permits required may imply allowed only with permit; if the target says prohibited but response says permits required, they contradict each other, unless target explicitly allows with permits.
- ""Limited hunting allowed"" must match target that hunting is allowed in some limited way, otherwise not.

**idx_3**  
- Response: ""pobox627,moabut84532""  
- Target: ""pobox907,moabut84532""  
- Analysis: Same city and zip code (moab ut 84532), difference is only in the box number (627 vs 907). These might be different mailing addresses but still likely related entities. However, strictly different PO boxes. Given criterion requires approx same semantics or same entity. Are these considered same entity? Probably not the same physical location. But as they are both PO boxes in the same city and zip, could be considered related. However, since criterion is about same entity, postal box number difference signals different entities. So best to be conservative and score 0.

- Analysis: One is a PO box address in springdale UT (zip 84764) and the other is a physical street address in springdale, UT (zip 84767), both related to Zion National Park. This strongly indicates that although the format differs, both point to Zion National Park in Springdale, UT. The small zip code difference is common between PO boxes and physical addresses.
