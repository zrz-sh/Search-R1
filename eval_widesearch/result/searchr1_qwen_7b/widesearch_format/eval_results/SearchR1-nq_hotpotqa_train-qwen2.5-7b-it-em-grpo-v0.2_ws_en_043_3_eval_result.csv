- idx_10: response ""virginia,westvirginia"" vs target ""virginia""  
  The response includes ""virginia"" as well as an additional ""westvirginia"". The criterion says semantics approximately the same or pointing to the same entity is sufficient. Adding extra information that includes the target should generally not be penalized. Hence, it counts as correct.

No deduction necessary as all responses either exactly match their targets or include the target entity with additional information (which is allowed).
