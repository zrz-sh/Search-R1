,,四川省地质灾害防治条例,示例法规A,0.0,"Let's analyze each pair step by step according to the criterion:

Criterion summary:  
- The response and the target answers need to have roughly the same semantics or point to the same entity.  
- Exact matching is not required.  
- Dates in different but reasonable formats referencing effectively the same date are acceptable (e.g., ""2025/03/28"" vs. ""2025/3/28"").  
- However, the dates need to represent roughly the same point in time.

---

**idx_0**  
- Response: ""2025/01/01""  
- Target: ""2025/3/28""  

These are two different dates: Jan 1, 2025 vs. Mar 28, 2025. They do not refer to the same day or essentially the same point in time. The criterion accepts different formats for the same date, but these are clearly different dates. Therefore, the semantics do not match.

Score: 0

**idx_1**  
- Response: ""2025/02/01""  
- Target: ""2025/3/28""  

Feb 1, 2025 vs. Mar 28, 2025 — different dates, so again, semantics do not match.

Criterion:  
- The response should have roughly the same meaning or refer to the same entity as the target answer.  
- Exact wording is not required.

---

**Item idx_0:**  
- Response: ""第1章第1条"" (Chapter 1, Article 1)  
- Target: ""8章65条"" (Chapter 8, Article 65)  
- Analysis: The response and target refer to different chapters and articles. They do not align in entity or meaning. Hence, this should be scored 0.

**Item idx_1:**  
- Response: ""第2章第2条"" (Chapter 2, Article 2)  
- Target: ""29条"" (Article 29) without chapter number  
- Analysis: The response gives a different chapter and article than the target's article number. Since they do not align in article number or chapter, they do not refer to the same entity. Score 0.

Criterion:
- The response should be semantically similar or refer to roughly the same entity as the standard answer.
- Exact word-for-word matching is not required.

---

**idx_0:**
- Response: ""四川省人民代表大会""
- Target: ""四川省人民代表大会常务委员会""

Analysis:
- ""四川省人民代表大会"" (Sichuan Provincial People's Congress) refers to the general legislative body.
- ""四川省人民代表大会常务委员会"" (Standing Committee of the Sichuan Provincial People's Congress) is a subset or a permanent committee of the former.
- They are related but not exactly the same entity.
- According to the criterion, the entities should be semantically similar or point to the same entity.
- Here, ""人民代表大会"" and its ""常务委员会"" are different entities, although closely related.
- Since the response misses the ""常务委员会"" part (Standing Committee), which is a distinct administrative body, the response does not refer to the same entity.
- Thus, the response is not semantically equivalent to the target.

**idx_1:**
- Response: ""四川省人民政府""
- Target: ""四川省人民代表大会常务委员会""

Analysis:
- ""四川省人民政府"" (Sichuan Provincial People's Government) is the executive branch of the provincial government.
- ""四川省人民代表大会常务委员会"" (Standing Committee of the Sichuan Provincial People's Congress) is a legislative body.
- These are clearly distinct organs.
