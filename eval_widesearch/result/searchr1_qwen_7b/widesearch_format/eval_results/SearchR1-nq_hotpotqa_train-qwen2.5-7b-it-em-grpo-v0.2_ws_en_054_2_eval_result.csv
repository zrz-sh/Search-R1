,,louisarmstrongneworleansinternational-northterminal,New Terminal One,0.0,"exact not match, response: na, target: 2019.0",2019.0,na,0.0,"number not near, response: 9.5, target: 1.3",1.3,9.50,1.0,key_match,0.0,"Let's analyze the provided pair:

- idx_0:
  - Response: ""2022""
  - Target: ""2016""
  
Criterion analysis:
- The response and target differ by 6 years.
- The criterion states a one-year gap is allowed.
- Since the difference here is greater than 1 year, the response does not meet the criterion for being approximately the same.
- Therefore, the score should be 0 (incorrect).

Final scoring result:
```json
{
    ""idx_0"": 0
}
```",2016,2022,0.0,"Let's analyze the given pair according to the criterion:

- Target answer: ""louisiana""
- Response: ""newyork""

Criterion: ""It is sufficient if the semantics are approximately the same as the reference answer or if they point to the same entity.""

Analysis:
- ""louisiana"" and ""newyork"" are two distinct entities, specifically different U.S. states.
- They do not have approximately the same semantics.
- They do not point to the same entity.

Therefore, the response does not meet the criterion for correctness.

Final score: 0
