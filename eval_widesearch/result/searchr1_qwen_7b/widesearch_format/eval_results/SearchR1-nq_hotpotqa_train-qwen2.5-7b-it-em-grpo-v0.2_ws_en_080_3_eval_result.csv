brazil,Brazil,,,2024parisolympics,2024 Paris Olympics,1.0,key_match,0.0,"Let's analyze each item step by step according to the grading criterion:  
- It is sufficient if the semantics are approximately the same as the reference answer or if they point to the same entity.  
- No need for exact word-for-word match.  
- Score can be only 0 or 1.

### idx_0
- Response: `football(2),basketball(1)`
- Target: `judo,gymnastics,volleyball`

Analysis:  
- Response mentions football and basketball.  
- Target mentions judo, gymnastics, volleyball.  
- No overlap or semantic equivalence between the response and target entities.  
- Therefore, not pointing to the same entity or approximate semantics.

Score: 0

---

### idx_1
- Response: `gymnastics(2),basketball(2)`
- Target: `canoeing,surfing,gymnastics,sailing,swimming,boxing,football`

Analysis:  
- Response includes gymnastics and basketball.  
- Target includes gymnastics (exact match) plus other sports.  
- Response thus includes at least one exact match entity with target (""gymnastics"").  
- Since semantics pointing to the same entity, this is sufficient.

Score: 1

---

### idx_2
- Response: `football(1),volleyball(1),basketball(1)`
- Target: `judo,athletics,boxing,sailing,volleyball(2),football`

Analysis:  
- Response entities: football, volleyball, basketball.  
- Target entities: judo, athletics, boxing, sailing, volleyball, football.  
- Football and volleyball appear in both sets (exact matches).  
- Basketball is extra, but the criterion does not mention penalties for extra entities.  
- So the response shares the main entities with target.
