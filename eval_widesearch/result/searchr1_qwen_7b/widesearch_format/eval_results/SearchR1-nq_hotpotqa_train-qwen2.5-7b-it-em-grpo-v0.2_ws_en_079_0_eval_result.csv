wynnmacau,Wynn Macau,,,1.0,key_match,0.0,"number not convertable, response: None, target: 1947.0",1947,NULL,1.0,"Analysis:

- Standard answer (target): ""wynnmacau,limited""
- Response: ""wynnmacaultd""

Step-by-step:

1. Check semantics / entity consistency:
   - The target is ""wynnmacau,limited"" which likely refers to a company named ""Wynn Macau, Limited.""
   - The response ""wynnmacaultd"" appears to be a misspelling or misscanning of ""wynnmacau ltd"" or ""wynnmacau limited"" without punctuation and spaces.
   - The response has ""wynnmacau"" followed by something close to ""ltd"" (written as ""lt d"").
   - Despite the typographical errors, the response attempts to represent the same entity ""Wynn Macau Limited.""
2. According to the criterion:
   - ""It is sufficient if the semantics are approximately the same as the reference answer or if they point to the same entity.""
   - No need for exact match.
3. The response points to the same entity as the target. So, it should receive a full score (1).

Final scoring:
