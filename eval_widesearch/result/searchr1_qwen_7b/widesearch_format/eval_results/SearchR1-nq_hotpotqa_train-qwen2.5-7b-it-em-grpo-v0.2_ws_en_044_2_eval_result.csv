- Target and response both say normal hours 10:00-18:00.
- Both mention extended hours until 21:00 on Wednesdays and Saturdays.
- Response specifies days (mon-sun and wed-sat) which aligns closely with the target.
- Slight wording differences but the semantics are equivalent.

Verdict: The semantics match well and point to the same entity.

Score: 1

### idx_3

- Target: ""mondaytofriday:10:30-18:00""
- Response: ""tue-sat10:30-18:00""

Analysis:
- Target is Monday-Friday, response is Tuesday-Saturday.
- The operating hours match (10:30-18:00).
- The days differ, changing meaning: response shifts one day forward, omitting Monday and adding Saturday.
- This is a significant difference in semantic content.

Verdict: Does not satisfy approximate semantic matching on days.

Score: 0
