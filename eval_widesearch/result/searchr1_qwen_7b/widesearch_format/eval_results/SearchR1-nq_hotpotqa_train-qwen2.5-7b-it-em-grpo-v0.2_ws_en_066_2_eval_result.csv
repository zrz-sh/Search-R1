Criterion:  
- The response is considered correct if the semantics are approximately the same as the reference answer or if they point to the same entity.  
- No need for word-for-word correspondence.

Scoring range: only 0 or 1.

**idx_0:**

- Response: ""279.0""  
- Target: ""$379.99""

Are these approximately the same or indicate the same entity/value?  
No. The numbers differ by about $100, which is a significant difference. They do not indicate the same value.

Score: 0

**idx_1:**

- Response: ""299.99""

Are these approximately the same or indicate the same entity/value?  
No. Again, about $100 difference. They do not indicate the same value.
