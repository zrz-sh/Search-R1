We need to judge if ""pwr"" is a semantically equivalent or approximately the same as the target.

""pwr"" is an abbreviation commonly used for ""Pressurized Water Reactor"". But here, the targets are specific reactor models/names, e.g.:

Note that the standard answers contain reactor types with suffix ""pwr"" in some, but for others, such as ""cnp-600"", ""vver-1000/428m(aes-91)"", they are different reactor types.

The key question: Does ""pwr"" alone convey the same entity or approximate meaning as the specific reactor model given as the standard answer?

Analysis:

- ""pwr"" is a general acronym: it stands for pressurized water reactor.  
- The target answers are specific reactor types/models (some of which are PWRs, but named fully).  
- The responses ""pwr"" do not specify any model or variant, only the reactor type.

Given the grading criterion that says: ""It is sufficient if the semantics are approximately the same as the reference answer or if they point to the same entity.""

""pwr"" is too generic to be considered approximately same or pointing to the same entity as the specific reactor model the target answers represent.

Therefore, the responses here do NOT meet the criterion of approximately the same semantics or same entity as the targets, since the response is only a generic reactor type abbreviation.

Hence, each response should be scored 0.

We need to judge if ""pwr"" is a semantically equivalent or approximately the same as the target.

""pwr"" is an abbreviation commonly used for ""Pressurized Water Reactor"". But here, the targets are specific reactor models/names, e.g.:

- cnp-600 (CNP is a reactor type), cpr-1000pwr, acpr-1000pwr, eprpwr, vver-1000/428m(aes-91)

Note that the standard answers contain reactor types with suffix ""pwr"" in some, but for others, such as ""cnp-600"", ""vver-1000/428m(aes-91)"", they are different reactor types.

The key question: Does ""pwr"" alone convey the same entity or approximate meaning as the specific reactor model given as the standard answer?

Analysis:

- ""pwr"" is a general acronym: it stands for pressurized water reactor.  
- The target answers are specific reactor types/models (some of which are PWRs, but named fully).  
- The responses ""pwr"" do not specify any model or variant, only the reactor type.

Given the grading criterion that says: ""It is sufficient if the semantics are approximately the same as the reference answer or if they point to the same entity.""

""pwr"" is too generic to be considered approximately same or pointing to the same entity as the specific reactor model the target answers represent.

Therefore, the responses here do NOT meet the criterion of approximately the same semantics or same entity as the targets, since the response is only a generic reactor type abbreviation.

Hence, each response should be scored 0.

Each pair has the standard answer as a specific entity or model code, e.g. ""cnp-600"", ""cpr-1000pwr"", ""eprpwr"", ""vver-1000/428m(aes-91)"", ""acpr-1000pwr"".

The responses are all ""pwr"".

We need to judge if ""pwr"" is a semantically equivalent or approximately the same as the target.

""pwr"" is an abbreviation commonly used for ""Pressurized Water Reactor"". But here, the targets are specific reactor models/names, e.g.:

- cnp-600 (CNP is a reactor type), cpr-1000pwr, acpr-1000pwr, eprpwr, vver-1000/428m(aes-91)

Note that the standard answers contain reactor types with suffix ""pwr"" in some, but for others, such as ""cnp-600"", ""vver-1000/428m(aes-91)"", they are different reactor types.

The key question: Does ""pwr"" alone convey the same entity or approximate meaning as the specific reactor model given as the standard answer?

Analysis:

- ""pwr"" is a general acronym: it stands for pressurized water reactor.  
- The target answers are specific reactor types/models (some of which are PWRs, but named fully).  
- The responses ""pwr"" do not specify any model or variant, only the reactor type.

Given the grading criterion that says: ""It is sufficient if the semantics are approximately the same as the reference answer or if they point to the same entity.""

""pwr"" is too generic to be considered approximately same or pointing to the same entity as the specific reactor model the target answers represent.

Therefore, the responses here do NOT meet the criterion of approximately the same semantics or same entity as the targets, since the response is only a generic reactor type abbreviation.

Hence, each response should be scored 0.

Each pair has the standard answer as a specific entity or model code, e.g. ""cnp-600"", ""cpr-1000pwr"", ""eprpwr"", ""vver-1000/428m(aes-91)"", ""acpr-1000pwr"".

We need to judge if ""pwr"" is a semantically equivalent or approximately the same as the target.

""pwr"" is an abbreviation commonly used for ""Pressurized Water Reactor"". But here, the targets are specific reactor models/names, e.g.:

- cnp-600 (CNP is a reactor type), cpr-1000pwr, acpr-1000pwr, eprpwr, vver-1000/428m(aes-91)

Note that the standard answers contain reactor types with suffix ""pwr"" in some, but for others, such as ""cnp-600"", ""vver-1000/428m(aes-91)"", they are different reactor types.

The key question: Does ""pwr"" alone convey the same entity or approximate meaning as the specific reactor model given as the standard answer?

Analysis:

- ""pwr"" is a general acronym: it stands for pressurized water reactor.  
- The target answers are specific reactor types/models (some of which are PWRs, but named fully).  
- The responses ""pwr"" do not specify any model or variant, only the reactor type.

Given the grading criterion that says: ""It is sufficient if the semantics are approximately the same as the reference answer or if they point to the same entity.""

""pwr"" is too generic to be considered approximately same or pointing to the same entity as the specific reactor model the target answers represent.

Therefore, the responses here do NOT meet the criterion of approximately the same semantics or same entity as the targets, since the response is only a generic reactor type abbreviation.

Hence, each response should be scored 0.
