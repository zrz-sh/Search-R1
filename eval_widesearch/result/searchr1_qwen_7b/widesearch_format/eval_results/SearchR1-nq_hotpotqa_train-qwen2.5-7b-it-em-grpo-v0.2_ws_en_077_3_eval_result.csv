**idx_0**  
- Response: ""kirstjennielsen""  
- Target: ""kristennielsen""  
Analysis: Both refer to likely the same person ""Kristen Nielsen"" (correctly ""Kristjen Nielsen"" is a known figure). The difference is a typo/misspelling in the response, but the intended entity is the same. According to the criterion, approximate semantics suffice, so this is acceptable.  
Score: 1

**idx_1**  
- Response: ""mickmulvaney""

**idx_2**
