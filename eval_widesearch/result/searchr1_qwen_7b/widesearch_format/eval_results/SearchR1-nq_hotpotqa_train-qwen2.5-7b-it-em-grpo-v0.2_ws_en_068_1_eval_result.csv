**idx_0**  
- Response: ""doubleday""  
- Target: ""scribner""  
Analysis:  
""Doubleday"" and ""Scribner"" are both publishing companies but are different entities. They do not refer to the same or approximate meaning/entity. Hence, they do not point to the same entity or share the same semantics.

- Response: ""farrar,strausandgiroux"" (Farrar, Straus and Giroux)  
- Target: ""hamishhamilton""  
Analysis:  
Farrar, Straus and Giroux is a US publishing company, and Hamish Hamilton is a British publishing imprint. They are distinct entities. Thus, they do not point to the same publisher and are not semantically approximately the same.  
Score: 0

**idx_2**  
- Response: ""randomhouse""

Analysis:  
Riverhead Books is an imprint of Penguin Group, while Random House is a separate large publishing group. They do not point to the same entity. Thus, not semantically equivalent.
