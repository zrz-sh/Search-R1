Criterion: Responses are scored 1 if the semantics are approximately the same or they point to the same entity as the target answer. They do not need to be word-for-word identical but must refer to the same entity.

### idx_0
- Response: ""harvarduniversity""
- Target: ""harvarduniversity""

The response exactly matches the target, referring to the same entity.

Score: 1

### idx_1
- Response: ""universityofmichiganannarbor""

These refer to two distinct entities: University of Michigan Ann Arbor vs Yale University.

Criterion:
- The semantics should be approximately the same or point to the same entity.
- No need for word-for-word correspondence.

**idx_0**  
- Response: ""harvarduniversity""  
- Target: ""harvardlibrary""  
Analysis:  
The target is ""harvardlibrary,"" which refers specifically to the library of Harvard University. The response is ""harvarduniversity,"" which is broader and points to the entire university, not specifically the library. The entities are related, but not the same entity. The criterion says ""approximately the same"" or ""point to the same entity."" Here, the response points to a related entity but not the same one.

Does this suffice? The criterion does not explicitly allow entities that only relate but are not the same, so this should be considered incorrect because the library is a specific part of the university, and naming the university does not mean the same as that particular library.

Score = 0

**idx_1**
