  Response is a subset of target, semantics basically same (points to mostly the same entities) → score = 1

- idx_3: response = ""8gb/16gb/32gb"", target = ""16gb/32gb""  
  Response contains target plus one more (8gb), which is close and points to same entities with some redundancy. This should count as sufficiently same → score = 1

  Response has 32gb while target has 64gb, so differs in the middle value.  
  They mostly overlap on 16gb and 128gb but differ on the middle element. According to criterion, the semantics should be approximately the same or point to the same entity set. Here the middle entity differs (32gb vs 64gb). Given that other elements are correct but the middle one is different, this does not fully match.

**idx_9**  
Response: ""water-resistant,firsttofeaturewirelesscharging""  
Target: ""removed3.5mmheadphonejack,ip67wateranddustresistance""  
Analysis: Response mentions water resistance and wireless charging. Target mentions removal of headphone jack and IP67 water resistance. Water resistance matches partially but response mentions wireless charging which is not in target. Since the removal headphone jack is missing and wireless charging is additional, approximate but partially overlapping. Given criterion says ""approximate semantics are sufficient""—since both mention water resistance, and wireless charging is another positive feature, this is arguably close enough.  
Score: 1

- Semantics approximately the same or point to the same entity → score = 1  
- Otherwise → score = 0  

---

**idx_0:**  
Response: ""$499/$599""  
Target: ""$499/$599""  
Exactly the same → 1

**idx_1:**  
Response: ""$199/$299""  
Target: ""$199/$299""  
Exactly the same → 1

**idx_2:**  
Response: ""$199/$299""  
Target: ""$99/$199/$299""  
Response lacks ""$99"", target has 3 prices, response has 2 but includes 2 of the target's 3. Not fully inclusive. Since the response is missing one price, it does not fully match the target, so likely 0.

**idx_3:**  
Response: ""$199/$299/$399""  
Target: ""$199/$299""  
Response has extra ""$399"". Since the response includes all prices of target (at least ""$199"" and ""$299"") plus one more price, the semantics point to the same entity with additional info. Since the criterion states ""approximately the same or point to the same entity"", extra items do not invalidate correctness. → 1

**idx_4:**  
Response: ""$199/$299""  
Target: ""$199/$299/$399""  
Response is missing ""$399"", so incomplete compared to target → 0

**idx_5:**  
Response: ""$199/$299/$349""  
Target: ""$199/$299/$399""  
Response differs in last item (""$349"" vs ""$399""). The set is similar but not same prices. Does this count? The criterion is semantic approximate same or pointing to the same entity. Here, price $349 instead of $399, the price points differ. These sets point to different prices and likely different products/pricing tiers, so → 0

**idx_6:**  
Same as idx_5: ""$199/$299/$349"" versus ""$199/$299/$399""  
→ 0

**idx_7:**  
Response: ""$199/$299/$449""  
Target: ""$199/$299/$399""  
Third price differs: $449 vs $399 → different prices → 0

**idx_8:**  
Response: ""$199/$299/$399""  
Target: ""$199/$299/$399""  
Exactly the same → 1

**idx_9:**  
Response: ""$399/$549/$649""  
Target: ""$649/$749/$849""  
No overlap except $649, but only one price overlap out of three, different ranges/prices → 0

**idx_10:**  
Response: ""$449/$649""  
Target: ""$699/$849""  
No overlap → 0

**idx_11:**  
Response: ""$999/$1,149""  
Target: ""$999/$1149""  
Highly similar, different formatting of 1,149 vs 1149. This is the same number → 1

**idx_12:**  
Response: ""$749/$849/$999""  
Target: ""$749/$799/$899""  
Overlap only in $749. Others differ ($849/$999 vs $799/$899). Price points differ, so likely → 0

**idx_13:**  
Response: ""$999/$1,149/$1,399""  
Target: ""$999/$1149/$1349""  
Compare prices: $999 matches, $1,149 vs $1149 same number, $1,399 vs $1349 differ by $50. Because the last price differs $1,399 vs $1,349, they are close but not identical. Given the margin might be considered different. Criterion: approximate semantics or same entities. The question is whether this $50 difference is acceptable as approximate? Probably not since prices have significance; slight difference may change tier or model. So 0

**idx_14:**  
Response: ""$399/$449/$549""  
Target: ""$699/$749/$849""  
No overlap → 0

**idx_15:**  
Response: ""$999/$1,099/$1,299""  
Target: ""$999/$1149/$1349""  
Compare prices: $999 matches; $1,099 vs $1149 differ by $50; $1,299 vs $1,349 also differ by $50. Differences here in second and third price points. Similar analysis as idx_13 → 0

**idx_16:**  
Response: ""$799/$849/$1,049""  
Target: ""$799/$849/$949""  
Difference at third price: $1,049 vs $949 differs by $100. Prices differ noticeably → 0

**idx_17:**  
Response: ""$799/$849/$1,099""  
Target: ""$799/$899/$1099""  
Compare prices: $799 exact; $849 vs $899 differ by $50; $1,099 vs $1099 same number.

The second price differs $849 vs $899. Different price points mean different pricing tiers. → 0

**idx_18:**  
Response: ""$799/$899/$1,099""  
Target: ""$799/$899/$1099""  
Difference only in formatting ""$1,099"" vs ""$1099"" same value → 1

**idx_19:**  
Response: ""$799/$899/$1,099""  
Target: ""$799/$899/$1099""  
Same as idx_18 → 1

Analysis: Response mentions water resistance and wireless charging. Target mentions removal of headphone jack and IP67 water resistance. Water resistance matches partially but response mentions wireless charging which is not in target. Since the removal headphone jack is missing and wireless charging is additional, approximate but partially overlapping. Given criterion says ""approximate semantics are sufficient""—since both mention water resistance, and wireless charging is another positive feature, this is arguably close enough.

Exactly the same → 1

Exactly the same → 1

**idx_2:**  
Response: ""$199/$299""  
Target: ""$99/$199/$299""  
Response lacks ""$99"", target has 3 prices, response has 2 but includes 2 of the target's 3. Not fully inclusive. Since the response is missing one price, it does not fully match the target, so likely 0.

**idx_3:**  
Response: ""$199/$299/$399""  
Target: ""$199/$299""  
Response has extra ""$399"". Since the response includes all prices of target (at least ""$199"" and ""$299"") plus one more price, the semantics point to the same entity with additional info. Since the criterion states ""approximately the same or point to the same entity"", extra items do not invalidate correctness. → 1

**idx_4:**  
Response: ""$199/$299""  
Target: ""$199/$299/$399""  
Response is missing ""$399"", so incomplete compared to target → 0

**idx_5:**  
Response: ""$199/$299/$349""  
Target: ""$199/$299/$399""  
Response differs in last item (""$349"" vs ""$399""). The set is similar but not same prices. Does this count? The criterion is semantic approximate same or pointing to the same entity. Here, price $349 instead of $399, the price points differ. These sets point to different prices and likely different products/pricing tiers, so → 0

**idx_6:**  
Same as idx_5: ""$199/$299/$349"" versus ""$199/$299/$399""  
→ 0

**idx_7:**  
Response: ""$199/$299/$449""  
Target: ""$199/$299/$399""  
Third price differs: $449 vs $399 → different prices → 0

**idx_8:**

Exactly the same → 1

**idx_9:**  
Response: ""$399/$549/$649""  
Target: ""$649/$749/$849""  
No overlap except $649, but only one price overlap out of three, different ranges/prices → 0

**idx_10:**

No overlap → 0

**idx_11:**  
Response: ""$999/$1,149""  
Target: ""$999/$1149""  
Highly similar, different formatting of 1,149 vs 1149. This is the same number → 1

**idx_12:**  
Response: ""$749/$849/$999""  
Target: ""$749/$799/$899""  
Overlap only in $749. Others differ ($849/$999 vs $799/$899). Price points differ, so likely → 0

**idx_13:**  
Response: ""$999/$1,149/$1,399""  
Target: ""$999/$1149/$1349""  
Compare prices: $999 matches, $1,149 vs $1149 same number, $1,399 vs $1349 differ by $50. Because the last price differs $1,399 vs $1,349, they are close but not identical. Given the margin might be considered different. Criterion: approximate semantics or same entities. The question is whether this $50 difference is acceptable as approximate? Probably not since prices have significance; slight difference may change tier or model. So 0

**idx_14:**  
Response: ""$399/$449/$549""  
Target: ""$699/$749/$849""  
No overlap → 0

**idx_15:**

Compare prices: $999 matches; $1,099 vs $1149 differ by $50; $1,299 vs $1,349 also differ by $50. Differences here in second and third price points. Similar analysis as idx_13 → 0

**idx_16:**

Compare prices: $799 exact; $849 vs $899 differ by $50; $1,099 vs $1099 same number.

The second price differs $849 vs $899. Different price points mean different pricing tiers. → 0

**idx_18:**

Criterion: It is sufficient if the semantics are approximately the same as the reference answer or if they point to the same entity.

- idx_0: response = ""4gb/8gb"", target = ""4gb/8gb""  
  Exact match → score = 1

  Different sets, no overlap → score = 0

- idx_2: response = ""8gb/16gb"", target = ""8gb/16gb/32gb""  
  Response is a subset of target, semantics basically same (points to mostly the same entities) → score = 1

- idx_3: response = ""8gb/16gb/32gb"", target = ""16gb/32gb""  
  Response contains target plus one more (8gb), which is close and points to same entities with some redundancy. This should count as sufficiently same → score = 1

  Response has 32gb while target has 64gb, so differs in the middle value.  
  They mostly overlap on 16gb and 128gb but differ on the middle element. According to criterion, the semantics should be approximately the same or point to the same entity set. Here the middle entity differs (32gb vs 64gb). Given that other elements are correct but the middle one is different, this does not fully match.

Compare prices: $999 matches, $1,149 vs $1149 same number, $1,399 vs $1349 differ by $50. Because the last price differs $1,399 vs $1,349, they are close but not identical. Given the margin might be considered different. Criterion: approximate semantics or same entities. The question is whether this $50 difference is acceptable as approximate? Probably not since prices have significance; slight difference may change tier or model. So 0

**idx_0**  
Response: ""firsttofeaturea3.5-inchmulti-touchdisplay""  
Target: ""revolutionarymodelwithtouchscreendesign""  
Analysis: Both refer to introducing a touchscreen design on the phone. Response points to the first phone with a 3.5-inch multi-touch display, which fits ""revolutionary model with touchscreen design.""  
Score: 1

---

**idx_1**  
Response: ""firsttofeatureedge,laterto3g""  
Target: ""supportfor3gnetwork,appstorelaunched""  
Analysis: Response says ""first to feature edge (network), later to 3g""; target focuses on 3G support and App Store launch. Edge network and 3G are related but distinct generations; ""later to 3g"" does not confirm 3G support matching target. Also, no mention of App Store. Semantics differ enough.  
Score: 0

**idx_2**  
Response: ""firsttofeaturecamerawithflash""

---

**idx_3**  
Response: ""firsttofeatureretinadisplay""  
Target: ""retinadisplay,firstledflash""  
Analysis: Response mentions first retina display; target mentions retina display and first LED flash. Response covers retina display, which matches partly, ignoring LED flash. Since retina display is covered, semantics are approximately the same.  
Score: 1

---

**idx_4**  
Response: ""firsttofeaturesiri""  
Target: ""introductionofsirivoiceassistant""  
Analysis: ""siri"" vs ""siri voice assistant"" are the same entity; minor spelling difference (""siri"" vs ""siri"") is acceptable.

Score: 1

---

**idx_9**  
Response: ""water-resistant,firsttofeaturewirelesscharging""  
Target: ""removed3.5mmheadphonejack,ip67wateranddustresistance""  
Analysis: Response mentions water resistance and wireless charging. Target mentions removal of headphone jack and IP67 water resistance. Water resistance matches partially but response mentions wireless charging which is not in target. Since the removal headphone jack is missing and wireless charging is additional, approximate but partially overlapping. Given criterion says ""approximate semantics are sufficient""—since both mention water resistance, and wireless charging is another positive feature, this is arguably close enough.  
Score: 1

Exactly the same → 1

**idx_2:**  
Response: ""$199/$299""  
Target: ""$99/$199/$299""  
Response lacks ""$99"", target has 3 prices, response has 2 but includes 2 of the target's 3. Not fully inclusive. Since the response is missing one price, it does not fully match the target, so likely 0.

**idx_3:**  
Response: ""$199/$299/$399""  
Target: ""$199/$299""  
Response has extra ""$399"". Since the response includes all prices of target (at least ""$199"" and ""$299"") plus one more price, the semantics point to the same entity with additional info. Since the criterion states ""approximately the same or point to the same entity"", extra items do not invalidate correctness. → 1

**idx_4:**  
Response: ""$199/$299""

**idx_5:**  
Response: ""$199/$299/$349""  
Target: ""$199/$299/$399""  
Response differs in last item (""$349"" vs ""$399""). The set is similar but not same prices. Does this count? The criterion is semantic approximate same or pointing to the same entity. Here, price $349 instead of $399, the price points differ. These sets point to different prices and likely different products/pricing tiers, so → 0

Overlap only in $749. Others differ ($849/$999 vs $799/$899). Price points differ, so likely → 0

**idx_13:**  
Response: ""$999/$1,149/$1,399""  
Target: ""$999/$1149/$1349""  
Compare prices: $999 matches, $1,149 vs $1149 same number, $1,399 vs $1349 differ by $50. Because the last price differs $1,399 vs $1,349, they are close but not identical. Given the margin might be considered different. Criterion: approximate semantics or same entities. The question is whether this $50 difference is acceptable as approximate? Probably not since prices have significance; slight difference may change tier or model. So 0

- Semantics approximately the same or point to the same entity → score = 1  
- Otherwise → score = 0  

---

**idx_0:**  
Response: ""$499/$599""  
Target: ""$499/$599""  
Exactly the same → 1

**idx_1:**  
Response: ""$199/$299""  
Target: ""$199/$299""  
Exactly the same → 1

**idx_2:**  
Response: ""$199/$299""  
Target: ""$99/$199/$299""  
Response lacks ""$99"", target has 3 prices, response has 2 but includes 2 of the target's 3. Not fully inclusive. Since the response is missing one price, it does not fully match the target, so likely 0.

**idx_3:**  
Response: ""$199/$299/$399""  
Target: ""$199/$299""  
Response has extra ""$399"". Since the response includes all prices of target (at least ""$199"" and ""$299"") plus one more price, the semantics point to the same entity with additional info. Since the criterion states ""approximately the same or point to the same entity"", extra items do not invalidate correctness. → 1

**idx_4:**  
Response: ""$199/$299""  
Target: ""$199/$299/$399""  
Response is missing ""$399"", so incomplete compared to target → 0

**idx_5:**  
Response: ""$199/$299/$349""  
Target: ""$199/$299/$399""  
Response differs in last item (""$349"" vs ""$399""). The set is similar but not same prices. Does this count? The criterion is semantic approximate same or pointing to the same entity. Here, price $349 instead of $399, the price points differ. These sets point to different prices and likely different products/pricing tiers, so → 0

**idx_6:**  
Same as idx_5: ""$199/$299/$349"" versus ""$199/$299/$399""  
→ 0

**idx_7:**  
Response: ""$199/$299/$449""  
Target: ""$199/$299/$399""  
Third price differs: $449 vs $399 → different prices → 0

**idx_8:**  
Response: ""$199/$299/$399""  
Target: ""$199/$299/$399""  
Exactly the same → 1

**idx_9:**  
Response: ""$399/$549/$649""  
Target: ""$649/$749/$849""  
No overlap except $649, but only one price overlap out of three, different ranges/prices → 0

**idx_10:**  
Response: ""$449/$649""  
Target: ""$699/$849""  
No overlap → 0

**idx_11:**  
Response: ""$999/$1,149""  
Target: ""$999/$1149""  
Highly similar, different formatting of 1,149 vs 1149. This is the same number → 1

**idx_12:**  
Response: ""$749/$849/$999""  
Target: ""$749/$799/$899""  
Overlap only in $749. Others differ ($849/$999 vs $799/$899). Price points differ, so likely → 0

**idx_13:**  
Response: ""$999/$1,149/$1,399""  
Target: ""$999/$1149/$1349""  
Compare prices: $999 matches, $1,149 vs $1149 same number, $1,399 vs $1349 differ by $50. Because the last price differs $1,399 vs $1,349, they are close but not identical. Given the margin might be considered different. Criterion: approximate semantics or same entities. The question is whether this $50 difference is acceptable as approximate? Probably not since prices have significance; slight difference may change tier or model. So 0

**idx_14:**  
Response: ""$399/$449/$549""  
Target: ""$699/$749/$849""  
No overlap → 0

**idx_15:**  
Response: ""$999/$1,099/$1,299""  
Target: ""$999/$1149/$1349""  
Compare prices: $999 matches; $1,099 vs $1149 differ by $50; $1,299 vs $1,349 also differ by $50. Differences here in second and third price points. Similar analysis as idx_13 → 0

**idx_16:**  
Response: ""$799/$849/$1,049""  
Target: ""$799/$849/$949""  
Difference at third price: $1,049 vs $949 differs by $100. Prices differ noticeably → 0

**idx_17:**  
Response: ""$799/$849/$1,099""  
Target: ""$799/$899/$1099""  
Compare prices: $799 exact; $849 vs $899 differ by $50; $1,099 vs $1099 same number.

The second price differs $849 vs $899. Different price points mean different pricing tiers. → 0

**idx_18:**  
Response: ""$799/$899/$1,099""  
Target: ""$799/$899/$1099""  
Difference only in formatting ""$1,099"" vs ""$1099"" same value → 1

**idx_19:**

Same as idx_18 → 1

  Different sets, no overlap → score = 0

- idx_2: response = ""8gb/16gb"", target = ""8gb/16gb/32gb""  
  Response is a subset of target, semantics basically same (points to mostly the same entities) → score = 1

- idx_3: response = ""8gb/16gb/32gb"", target = ""16gb/32gb""  
  Response contains target plus one more (8gb), which is close and points to same entities with some redundancy. This should count as sufficiently same → score = 1

- idx_4: response = ""16gb/32gb"", target = ""16gb/32gb/64gb""

  Response has 32gb while target has 64gb, so differs in the middle value.  
  They mostly overlap on 16gb and 128gb but differ on the middle element. According to criterion, the semantics should be approximately the same or point to the same entity set. Here the middle entity differs (32gb vs 64gb). Given that other elements are correct but the middle one is different, this does not fully match.

Response lacks ""$99"", target has 3 prices, response has 2 but includes 2 of the target's 3. Not fully inclusive. Since the response is missing one price, it does not fully match the target, so likely 0.

**idx_3:**  
Response: ""$199/$299/$399""  
Target: ""$199/$299""  
Response has extra ""$399"". Since the response includes all prices of target (at least ""$199"" and ""$299"") plus one more price, the semantics point to the same entity with additional info. Since the criterion states ""approximately the same or point to the same entity"", extra items do not invalidate correctness. → 1

**idx_4:**  
Response: ""$199/$299""  
Target: ""$199/$299/$399""  
Response is missing ""$399"", so incomplete compared to target → 0

**idx_5:**  
Response: ""$199/$299/$349""  
Target: ""$199/$299/$399""  
Response differs in last item (""$349"" vs ""$399""). The set is similar but not same prices. Does this count? The criterion is semantic approximate same or pointing to the same entity. Here, price $349 instead of $399, the price points differ. These sets point to different prices and likely different products/pricing tiers, so → 0

**idx_6:**  
Same as idx_5: ""$199/$299/$349"" versus ""$199/$299/$399""  
→ 0

**idx_7:**  
Response: ""$199/$299/$449""  
Target: ""$199/$299/$399""  
Third price differs: $449 vs $399 → different prices → 0

**idx_8:**  
Response: ""$199/$299/$399""  
Target: ""$199/$299/$399""  
Exactly the same → 1

**idx_9:**  
Response: ""$399/$549/$649""

No overlap → 0

**idx_11:**  
Response: ""$999/$1,149""  
Target: ""$999/$1149""  
Highly similar, different formatting of 1,149 vs 1149. This is the same number → 1

**idx_12:**  
Response: ""$749/$849/$999""  
Target: ""$749/$799/$899""  
Overlap only in $749. Others differ ($849/$999 vs $799/$899). Price points differ, so likely → 0

**idx_13:**  
Response: ""$999/$1,149/$1,399""  
Target: ""$999/$1149/$1349""  
Compare prices: $999 matches, $1,149 vs $1149 same number, $1,399 vs $1349 differ by $50. Because the last price differs $1,399 vs $1,349, they are close but not identical. Given the margin might be considered different. Criterion: approximate semantics or same entities. The question is whether this $50 difference is acceptable as approximate? Probably not since prices have significance; slight difference may change tier or model. So 0

**idx_14:**  
Response: ""$399/$449/$549""  
Target: ""$699/$749/$849""  
No overlap → 0

**idx_15:**  
Response: ""$999/$1,099/$1,299""  
Target: ""$999/$1149/$1349""  
Compare prices: $999 matches; $1,099 vs $1149 differ by $50; $1,299 vs $1,349 also differ by $50. Differences here in second and third price points. Similar analysis as idx_13 → 0

**idx_16:**  
Response: ""$799/$849/$1,049""  
Target: ""$799/$849/$949""  
Difference at third price: $1,049 vs $949 differs by $100. Prices differ noticeably → 0

**idx_17:**  
Response: ""$799/$849/$1,099""  
Target: ""$799/$899/$1099""  
Compare prices: $799 exact; $849 vs $899 differ by $50; $1,099 vs $1099 same number.

The second price differs $849 vs $899. Different price points mean different pricing tiers. → 0

**idx_18:**  
Response: ""$799/$899/$1,099""  
Target: ""$799/$899/$1099""  
Difference only in formatting ""$1,099"" vs ""$1099"" same value → 1

**idx_19:**  
Response: ""$799/$899/$1,099""  
Target: ""$799/$899/$1099""  
Same as idx_18 → 1

**idx_20:**

  Response has 32gb while target has 64gb, so differs in the middle value.  
  They mostly overlap on 16gb and 128gb but differ on the middle element. According to criterion, the semantics should be approximately the same or point to the same entity set.

**idx_0**  
Response: ""firsttofeaturea3.5-inchmulti-touchdisplay""  
Target: ""revolutionarymodelwithtouchscreendesign""  
Analysis: Both refer to introducing a touchscreen design on the phone. Response points to the first phone with a 3.5-inch multi-touch display, which fits ""revolutionary model with touchscreen design.""  
Score: 1

---

**idx_1**  
Response: ""firsttofeatureedge,laterto3g""  
Target: ""supportfor3gnetwork,appstorelaunched""  
Analysis: Response says ""first to feature edge (network), later to 3g""; target focuses on 3G support and App Store launch. Edge network and 3G are related but distinct generations; ""later to 3g"" does not confirm 3G support matching target. Also, no mention of App Store. Semantics differ enough.  
Score: 0

**idx_2**  
Response: ""firsttofeaturecamerawithflash""

Analysis: Completely different features—camera flash vs voice control.  
Score: 0

---

**idx_3**  
Response: ""firsttofeatureretinadisplay""  
Target: ""retinadisplay,firstledflash""  
Analysis: Response mentions first retina display; target mentions retina display and first LED flash. Response covers retina display, which matches partly, ignoring LED flash. Since retina display is covered, semantics are approximately the same.  
Score: 1

---

**idx_4**  
Response: ""firsttofeaturesiri""  
Target: ""introductionofsirivoiceassistant""  
Analysis: ""siri"" vs ""siri voice assistant"" are the same entity; minor spelling difference (""siri"" vs ""siri"") is acceptable.

**idx_8**  
Response: ""firsttofeature3dtouch""  
Target: ""introductionof3dtouchtechnology""  
Analysis: Same thing, worded differently but semantically identical.  
Score: 1

---

**idx_9**  
Response: ""water-resistant,firsttofeaturewirelesscharging""  
Target: ""removed3.5mmheadphonejack,ip67wateranddustresistance""  
Analysis: Response mentions water resistance and wireless charging. Target mentions removal of headphone jack and IP67 water resistance. Water resistance matches partially but response mentions wireless charging which is not in target. Since the removal headphone jack is missing and wireless charging is additional, approximate but partially overlapping. Given criterion says ""approximate semantics are sufficient""—since both mention water resistance, and wireless charging is another positive feature, this is arguably close enough.  
Score: 1

**idx_10**  
Response: ""firsttofeaturewirelesscharging,ceramicshieldglass""  
Target: ""glassbackwithwirelesscharging""  
Analysis: Both mention wireless charging with glass. Response adds ceramic shield glass, which is additional detail. Semantically consistent.

Response: ""firsttofeaturetriple-lenscamerasystem""  
Target: ""ultra-widecameraandu2chipforuwb""  
Analysis: Triple lens camera vs ultra wide camera and U2 chip for UWB; partially overlapping, since ultra wide camera may be part of triple lens, but target does not explicitly say triple lens. U2 chip and triple lens are different. Not close enough.

- Semantics approximately the same or point to the same entity → score = 1  
- Otherwise → score = 0  

---

**idx_0:**  
Response: ""$499/$599""  
Target: ""$499/$599""  
Exactly the same → 1

**idx_1:**  
Response: ""$199/$299""  
Target: ""$199/$299""  
Exactly the same → 1

**idx_2:**  
Response: ""$199/$299""  
Target: ""$99/$199/$299""  
Response lacks ""$99"", target has 3 prices, response has 2 but includes 2 of the target's 3. Not fully inclusive. Since the response is missing one price, it does not fully match the target, so likely 0.

**idx_3:**  
Response: ""$199/$299/$399""  
Target: ""$199/$299""  
Response has extra ""$399"". Since the response includes all prices of target (at least ""$199"" and ""$299"") plus one more price, the semantics point to the same entity with additional info. Since the criterion states ""approximately the same or point to the same entity"", extra items do not invalidate correctness. → 1

**idx_4:**  
Response: ""$199/$299""  
Target: ""$199/$299/$399""  
Response is missing ""$399"", so incomplete compared to target → 0

**idx_5:**  
Response: ""$199/$299/$349""  
Target: ""$199/$299/$399""  
Response differs in last item (""$349"" vs ""$399""). The set is similar but not same prices. Does this count? The criterion is semantic approximate same or pointing to the same entity. Here, price $349 instead of $399, the price points differ. These sets point to different prices and likely different products/pricing tiers, so → 0

**idx_6:**  
Same as idx_5: ""$199/$299/$349"" versus ""$199/$299/$399""  
→ 0

**idx_7:**  
Response: ""$199/$299/$449""  
Target: ""$199/$299/$399""  
Third price differs: $449 vs $399 → different prices → 0

**idx_8:**  
Response: ""$199/$299/$399""  
Target: ""$199/$299/$399""  
Exactly the same → 1

**idx_9:**  
Response: ""$399/$549/$649""  
Target: ""$649/$749/$849""  
No overlap except $649, but only one price overlap out of three, different ranges/prices → 0

**idx_10:**  
Response: ""$449/$649""  
Target: ""$699/$849""  
No overlap → 0

**idx_11:**  
Response: ""$999/$1,149""  
Target: ""$999/$1149""  
Highly similar, different formatting of 1,149 vs 1149. This is the same number → 1

**idx_12:**  
Response: ""$749/$849/$999""  
Target: ""$749/$799/$899""  
Overlap only in $749. Others differ ($849/$999 vs $799/$899). Price points differ, so likely → 0

**idx_13:**  
Response: ""$999/$1,149/$1,399""  
Target: ""$999/$1149/$1349""  
Compare prices: $999 matches, $1,149 vs $1149 same number, $1,399 vs $1349 differ by $50. Because the last price differs $1,399 vs $1,349, they are close but not identical. Given the margin might be considered different. Criterion: approximate semantics or same entities. The question is whether this $50 difference is acceptable as approximate? Probably not since prices have significance; slight difference may change tier or model. So 0

**idx_14:**  
Response: ""$399/$449/$549""  
Target: ""$699/$749/$849""  
No overlap → 0

**idx_15:**  
Response: ""$999/$1,099/$1,299""  
Target: ""$999/$1149/$1349""  
Compare prices: $999 matches; $1,099 vs $1149 differ by $50; $1,299 vs $1,349 also differ by $50. Differences here in second and third price points. Similar analysis as idx_13 → 0

**idx_16:**  
Response: ""$799/$849/$1,049""  
Target: ""$799/$849/$949""  
Difference at third price: $1,049 vs $949 differs by $100. Prices differ noticeably → 0

**idx_17:**  
Response: ""$799/$849/$1,099""  
Target: ""$799/$899/$1099""  
Compare prices: $799 exact; $849 vs $899 differ by $50; $1,099 vs $1099 same number.

The second price differs $849 vs $899. Different price points mean different pricing tiers. → 0

**idx_18:**  
Response: ""$799/$899/$1,099""  
Target: ""$799/$899/$1099""  
Difference only in formatting ""$1,099"" vs ""$1099"" same value → 1

**idx_19:**

**idx_0:**  
Response: ""$499/$599""  
Target: ""$499/$599""  
Exactly the same → 1

**idx_1:**  
Response: ""$199/$299""  
Target: ""$199/$299""  
Exactly the same → 1

**idx_2:**  
Response: ""$199/$299""  
Target: ""$99/$199/$299""  
Response lacks ""$99"", target has 3 prices, response has 2 but includes 2 of the target's 3. Not fully inclusive. Since the response is missing one price, it does not fully match the target, so likely 0.

**idx_3:**  
Response: ""$199/$299/$399""  
Target: ""$199/$299""  
Response has extra ""$399"". Since the response includes all prices of target (at least ""$199"" and ""$299"") plus one more price, the semantics point to the same entity with additional info. Since the criterion states ""approximately the same or point to the same entity"", extra items do not invalidate correctness. → 1

**idx_4:**  
Response: ""$199/$299""  
Target: ""$199/$299/$399""  
Response is missing ""$399"", so incomplete compared to target → 0

**idx_5:**  
Response: ""$199/$299/$349""  
Target: ""$199/$299/$399""  
Response differs in last item (""$349"" vs ""$399""). The set is similar but not same prices. Does this count? The criterion is semantic approximate same or pointing to the same entity. Here, price $349 instead of $399, the price points differ. These sets point to different prices and likely different products/pricing tiers, so → 0

**idx_6:**  
Same as idx_5: ""$199/$299/$349"" versus ""$199/$299/$399""  
→ 0

**idx_7:**  
Response: ""$199/$299/$449""  
Target: ""$199/$299/$399""  
Third price differs: $449 vs $399 → different prices → 0

**idx_8:**  
Response: ""$199/$299/$399""  
Target: ""$199/$299/$399""  
Exactly the same → 1

**idx_9:**  
Response: ""$399/$549/$649""  
Target: ""$649/$749/$849""  
No overlap except $649, but only one price overlap out of three, different ranges/prices → 0

**idx_10:**

No overlap → 0

**idx_11:**  
Response: ""$999/$1,149""  
Target: ""$999/$1149""  
Highly similar, different formatting of 1,149 vs 1149. This is the same number → 1

**idx_12:**  
Response: ""$749/$849/$999""  
Target: ""$749/$799/$899""  
Overlap only in $749. Others differ ($849/$999 vs $799/$899). Price points differ, so likely → 0

**idx_13:**  
Response: ""$999/$1,149/$1,399""  
Target: ""$999/$1149/$1349""  
Compare prices: $999 matches, $1,149 vs $1149 same number, $1,399 vs $1349 differ by $50. Because the last price differs $1,399 vs $1,349, they are close but not identical. Given the margin might be considered different. Criterion: approximate semantics or same entities. The question is whether this $50 difference is acceptable as approximate? Probably not since prices have significance; slight difference may change tier or model. So 0

**idx_14:**  
Response: ""$399/$449/$549""  
Target: ""$699/$749/$849""  
No overlap → 0

**idx_15:**

Target: ""$799/$899/$1099""  
Compare prices: $799 exact; $849 vs $899 differ by $50; $1,099 vs $1099 same number.

The second price differs $849 vs $899. Different price points mean different pricing tiers. → 0

**idx_18:**

  Different sets, no overlap → score = 0

- idx_2: response = ""8gb/16gb"", target = ""8gb/16gb/32gb""  
  Response is a subset of target, semantics basically same (points to mostly the same entities) → score = 1

- idx_3: response = ""8gb/16gb/32gb"", target = ""16gb/32gb""  
  Response contains target plus one more (8gb), which is close and points to same entities with some redundancy. This should count as sufficiently same → score = 1

- idx_8: response = ""16gb/32gb/128gb"", target = ""16gb/64gb/128gb""  
  Response has 32gb while target has 64gb, so differs in the middle value.  
  They mostly overlap on 16gb and 128gb but differ on the middle element. According to criterion, the semantics should be approximately the same or point to the same entity set. Here the middle entity differs (32gb vs 64gb). Given that other elements are correct but the middle one is different, this does not fully match.

**idx_1**  
Response: ""firsttofeatureedge,laterto3g""  
Target: ""supportfor3gnetwork,appstorelaunched""  
Analysis: Response says ""first to feature edge (network), later to 3g""; target focuses on 3G support and App Store launch. Edge network and 3G are related but distinct generations; ""later to 3g"" does not confirm 3G support matching target. Also, no mention of App Store. Semantics differ enough.

**idx_9**  
Response: ""water-resistant,firsttofeaturewirelesscharging""  
Target: ""removed3.5mmheadphonejack,ip67wateranddustresistance""  
Analysis: Response mentions water resistance and wireless charging. Target mentions removal of headphone jack and IP67 water resistance. Water resistance matches partially but response mentions wireless charging which is not in target. Since the removal headphone jack is missing and wireless charging is additional, approximate but partially overlapping. Given criterion says ""approximate semantics are sufficient""—since both mention water resistance, and wireless charging is another positive feature, this is arguably close enough.  
Score: 1

Analysis: Response says ""first to feature edge (network), later to 3g""; target focuses on 3G support and App Store launch. Edge network and 3G are related but distinct generations; ""later to 3g"" does not confirm 3G support matching target. Also, no mention of App Store. Semantics differ enough.

**idx_9**  
Response: ""water-resistant,firsttofeaturewirelesscharging""  
Target: ""removed3.5mmheadphonejack,ip67wateranddustresistance""  
Analysis: Response mentions water resistance and wireless charging. Target mentions removal of headphone jack and IP67 water resistance. Water resistance matches partially but response mentions wireless charging which is not in target. Since the removal headphone jack is missing and wireless charging is additional, approximate but partially overlapping. Given criterion says ""approximate semantics are sufficient""—since both mention water resistance, and wireless charging is another positive feature, this is arguably close enough.  
Score: 1

**idx_0:**  
Response: ""$499/$599""  
Target: ""$499/$599""  
Exactly the same → 1

**idx_1:**  
Response: ""$199/$299""  
Target: ""$199/$299""  
Exactly the same → 1

**idx_2:**  
Response: ""$199/$299""  
Target: ""$99/$199/$299""  
Response lacks ""$99"", target has 3 prices, response has 2 but includes 2 of the target's 3. Not fully inclusive. Since the response is missing one price, it does not fully match the target, so likely 0.

**idx_3:**  
Response: ""$199/$299/$399""  
Target: ""$199/$299""  
Response has extra ""$399"". Since the response includes all prices of target (at least ""$199"" and ""$299"") plus one more price, the semantics point to the same entity with additional info. Since the criterion states ""approximately the same or point to the same entity"", extra items do not invalidate correctness. → 1

**idx_4:**  
Response: ""$199/$299""  
Target: ""$199/$299/$399""  
Response is missing ""$399"", so incomplete compared to target → 0

**idx_5:**  
Response: ""$199/$299/$349""  
Target: ""$199/$299/$399""  
Response differs in last item (""$349"" vs ""$399""). The set is similar but not same prices. Does this count? The criterion is semantic approximate same or pointing to the same entity. Here, price $349 instead of $399, the price points differ. These sets point to different prices and likely different products/pricing tiers, so → 0

**idx_6:**  
Same as idx_5: ""$199/$299/$349"" versus ""$199/$299/$399""  
→ 0

**idx_7:**  
Response: ""$199/$299/$449""  
Target: ""$199/$299/$399""  
Third price differs: $449 vs $399 → different prices → 0

**idx_8:**  
Response: ""$199/$299/$399""  
Target: ""$199/$299/$399""  
Exactly the same → 1

**idx_9:**  
Response: ""$399/$549/$649""  
Target: ""$649/$749/$849""  
No overlap except $649, but only one price overlap out of three, different ranges/prices → 0

**idx_10:**  
Response: ""$449/$649""  
Target: ""$699/$849""  
No overlap → 0

**idx_11:**  
Response: ""$999/$1,149""  
Target: ""$999/$1149""  
Highly similar, different formatting of 1,149 vs 1149. This is the same number → 1

**idx_12:**  
Response: ""$749/$849/$999""  
Target: ""$749/$799/$899""  
Overlap only in $749. Others differ ($849/$999 vs $799/$899). Price points differ, so likely → 0

**idx_13:**  
Response: ""$999/$1,149/$1,399""  
Target: ""$999/$1149/$1349""  
Compare prices: $999 matches, $1,149 vs $1149 same number, $1,399 vs $1349 differ by $50. Because the last price differs $1,399 vs $1,349, they are close but not identical. Given the margin might be considered different. Criterion: approximate semantics or same entities. The question is whether this $50 difference is acceptable as approximate? Probably not since prices have significance; slight difference may change tier or model. So 0

**idx_14:**  
Response: ""$399/$449/$549""  
Target: ""$699/$749/$849""  
No overlap → 0

**idx_15:**  
Response: ""$999/$1,099/$1,299""  
Target: ""$999/$1149/$1349""  
Compare prices: $999 matches; $1,099 vs $1149 differ by $50; $1,299 vs $1,349 also differ by $50. Differences here in second and third price points. Similar analysis as idx_13 → 0

**idx_16:**  
Response: ""$799/$849/$1,049""  
Target: ""$799/$849/$949""  
Difference at third price: $1,049 vs $949 differs by $100. Prices differ noticeably → 0

**idx_17:**  
Response: ""$799/$849/$1,099""  
Target: ""$799/$899/$1099""  
Compare prices: $799 exact; $849 vs $899 differ by $50; $1,099 vs $1099 same number.

The second price differs $849 vs $899. Different price points mean different pricing tiers. → 0

**idx_18:**  
Response: ""$799/$899/$1,099""

**idx_0:**  
Response: ""$499/$599""  
Target: ""$499/$599""  
Exactly the same → 1

**idx_1:**  
Response: ""$199/$299""  
Target: ""$199/$299""  
Exactly the same → 1

**idx_2:**  
Response: ""$199/$299""  
Target: ""$99/$199/$299""  
Response lacks ""$99"", target has 3 prices, response has 2 but includes 2 of the target's 3. Not fully inclusive. Since the response is missing one price, it does not fully match the target, so likely 0.

**idx_3:**  
Response: ""$199/$299/$399""  
Target: ""$199/$299""  
Response has extra ""$399"". Since the response includes all prices of target (at least ""$199"" and ""$299"") plus one more price, the semantics point to the same entity with additional info. Since the criterion states ""approximately the same or point to the same entity"", extra items do not invalidate correctness. → 1

**idx_4:**  
Response: ""$199/$299""  
Target: ""$199/$299/$399""  
Response is missing ""$399"", so incomplete compared to target → 0

**idx_5:**  
Response: ""$199/$299/$349""  
Target: ""$199/$299/$399""  
Response differs in last item (""$349"" vs ""$399""). The set is similar but not same prices. Does this count? The criterion is semantic approximate same or pointing to the same entity. Here, price $349 instead of $399, the price points differ. These sets point to different prices and likely different products/pricing tiers, so → 0

**idx_6:**  
Same as idx_5: ""$199/$299/$349"" versus ""$199/$299/$399""  
→ 0

**idx_7:**  
Response: ""$199/$299/$449""  
Target: ""$199/$299/$399""  
Third price differs: $449 vs $399 → different prices → 0

**idx_8:**

Exactly the same → 1

**idx_9:**  
Response: ""$399/$549/$649""  
Target: ""$649/$749/$849""  
No overlap except $649, but only one price overlap out of three, different ranges/prices → 0

**idx_10:**  
Response: ""$449/$649""

No overlap → 0

**idx_11:**  
Response: ""$999/$1,149""  
Target: ""$999/$1149""  
Highly similar, different formatting of 1,149 vs 1149. This is the same number → 1

**idx_12:**  
Response: ""$749/$849/$999""  
Target: ""$749/$799/$899""  
Overlap only in $749. Others differ ($849/$999 vs $799/$899). Price points differ, so likely → 0

**idx_13:**  
Response: ""$999/$1,149/$1,399""  
Target: ""$999/$1149/$1349""  
Compare prices: $999 matches, $1,149 vs $1149 same number, $1,399 vs $1349 differ by $50. Because the last price differs $1,399 vs $1,349, they are close but not identical. Given the margin might be considered different. Criterion: approximate semantics or same entities. The question is whether this $50 difference is acceptable as approximate? Probably not since prices have significance; slight difference may change tier or model. So 0

**idx_14:**  
Response: ""$399/$449/$549""  
Target: ""$699/$749/$849""  
No overlap → 0

**idx_15:**

Compare prices: $999 matches; $1,099 vs $1149 differ by $50; $1,299 vs $1,349 also differ by $50. Differences here in second and third price points. Similar analysis as idx_13 → 0

**idx_16:**

Compare prices: $799 exact; $849 vs $899 differ by $50; $1,099 vs $1099 same number.

The second price differs $849 vs $899. Different price points mean different pricing tiers. → 0

**idx_18:**

- idx_0: response = ""4gb/8gb"", target = ""4gb/8gb""  
  Exact match → score = 1

  Different sets, no overlap → score = 0

- idx_2: response = ""8gb/16gb"", target = ""8gb/16gb/32gb""  
  Response is a subset of target, semantics basically same (points to mostly the same entities) → score = 1

- idx_3: response = ""8gb/16gb/32gb"", target = ""16gb/32gb""  
  Response contains target plus one more (8gb), which is close and points to same entities with some redundancy. This should count as sufficiently same → score = 1

- idx_4: response = ""16gb/32gb"", target = ""16gb/32gb/64gb""

  Response has 32gb while target has 64gb, so differs in the middle value.  
  They mostly overlap on 16gb and 128gb but differ on the middle element. According to criterion, the semantics should be approximately the same or point to the same entity set. Here the middle entity differs (32gb vs 64gb). Given that other elements are correct but the middle one is different, this does not fully match.

**idx_9:**  
Response: ""$399/$549/$649""  
Target: ""$649/$749/$849""  
No overlap except $649, but only one price overlap out of three, different ranges/prices → 0

**idx_10:**  
Response: ""$449/$649""

No overlap → 0

**idx_11:**  
Response: ""$999/$1,149""  
Target: ""$999/$1149""  
Highly similar, different formatting of 1,149 vs 1149. This is the same number → 1

**idx_12:**  
Response: ""$749/$849/$999""  
Target: ""$749/$799/$899""  
Overlap only in $749. Others differ ($849/$999 vs $799/$899). Price points differ, so likely → 0

**idx_13:**  
Response: ""$999/$1,149/$1,399""  
Target: ""$999/$1149/$1349""  
Compare prices: $999 matches, $1,149 vs $1149 same number, $1,399 vs $1349 differ by $50. Because the last price differs $1,399 vs $1,349, they are close but not identical. Given the margin might be considered different. Criterion: approximate semantics or same entities. The question is whether this $50 difference is acceptable as approximate? Probably not since prices have significance; slight difference may change tier or model. So 0

**idx_14:**  
Response: ""$399/$449/$549""  
Target: ""$699/$749/$849""  
No overlap → 0

**idx_15:**

Compare prices: $999 matches; $1,099 vs $1149 differ by $50; $1,299 vs $1,349 also differ by $50. Differences here in second and third price points. Similar analysis as idx_13 → 0

**idx_16:**  
Response: ""$799/$849/$1,049""  
Target: ""$799/$849/$949""  
Difference at third price: $1,049 vs $949 differs by $100. Prices differ noticeably → 0

**idx_17:**  
Response: ""$799/$849/$1,099""  
Target: ""$799/$899/$1099""  
Compare prices: $799 exact; $849 vs $899 differ by $50; $1,099 vs $1099 same number.

The second price differs $849 vs $899. Different price points mean different pricing tiers. → 0

**idx_18:**  
Response: ""$799/$899/$1,099""  
Target: ""$799/$899/$1099""  
Difference only in formatting ""$1,099"" vs ""$1099"" same value → 1

**idx_19:**

**idx_0**  
Response: ""firsttofeaturea3.5-inchmulti-touchdisplay""  
Target: ""revolutionarymodelwithtouchscreendesign""  
Analysis: Both refer to introducing a touchscreen design on the phone. Response points to the first phone with a 3.5-inch multi-touch display, which fits ""revolutionary model with touchscreen design.""  
Score: 1

---

**idx_1**  
Response: ""firsttofeatureedge,laterto3g""  
Target: ""supportfor3gnetwork,appstorelaunched""  
Analysis: Response says ""first to feature edge (network), later to 3g""; target focuses on 3G support and App Store launch. Edge network and 3G are related but distinct generations; ""later to 3g"" does not confirm 3G support matching target. Also, no mention of App Store. Semantics differ enough.  
Score: 0

Analysis: Completely different features—camera flash vs voice control.  
Score: 0

---

**idx_3**  
Response: ""firsttofeatureretinadisplay""  
Target: ""retinadisplay,firstledflash""  
Analysis: Response mentions first retina display; target mentions retina display and first LED flash. Response covers retina display, which matches partly, ignoring LED flash. Since retina display is covered, semantics are approximately the same.  
Score: 1

---

**idx_4**  
Response: ""firsttofeaturesiri""  
Target: ""introductionofsirivoiceassistant""  
Analysis: ""siri"" vs ""siri voice assistant"" are the same entity; minor spelling difference (""siri"" vs ""siri"") is acceptable.  
Score: 1

**idx_8**  
Response: ""firsttofeature3dtouch""  
Target: ""introductionof3dtouchtechnology""  
Analysis: Same thing, worded differently but semantically identical.  
Score: 1

---

**idx_9**  
Response: ""water-resistant,firsttofeaturewirelesscharging""  
Target: ""removed3.5mmheadphonejack,ip67wateranddustresistance""  
Analysis: Response mentions water resistance and wireless charging. Target mentions removal of headphone jack and IP67 water resistance. Water resistance matches partially but response mentions wireless charging which is not in target. Since the removal headphone jack is missing and wireless charging is additional, approximate but partially overlapping. Given criterion says ""approximate semantics are sufficient""—since both mention water resistance, and wireless charging is another positive feature, this is arguably close enough.  
Score: 1

**idx_10**  
Response: ""firsttofeaturewirelesscharging,ceramicshieldglass""  
Target: ""glassbackwithwirelesscharging""  
Analysis: Both mention wireless charging with glass. Response adds ceramic shield glass, which is additional detail. Semantically consistent.

Exactly the same → 1

**idx_2:**  
Response: ""$199/$299""  
Target: ""$99/$199/$299""  
Response lacks ""$99"", target has 3 prices, response has 2 but includes 2 of the target's 3. Not fully inclusive. Since the response is missing one price, it does not fully match the target, so likely 0.

**idx_3:**  
Response: ""$199/$299/$399""  
Target: ""$199/$299""  
Response has extra ""$399"". Since the response includes all prices of target (at least ""$199"" and ""$299"") plus one more price, the semantics point to the same entity with additional info. Since the criterion states ""approximately the same or point to the same entity"", extra items do not invalidate correctness. → 1

Target: ""$199/$299/$399""  
Response differs in last item (""$349"" vs ""$399""). The set is similar but not same prices. Does this count? The criterion is semantic approximate same or pointing to the same entity. Here, price $349 instead of $399, the price points differ. These sets point to different prices and likely different products/pricing tiers, so → 0

Compare prices: $999 matches, $1,149 vs $1149 same number, $1,399 vs $1349 differ by $50. Because the last price differs $1,399 vs $1,349, they are close but not identical. Given the margin might be considered different. Criterion: approximate semantics or same entities. The question is whether this $50 difference is acceptable as approximate? Probably not since prices have significance; slight difference may change tier or model. So 0

- Semantics approximately the same or point to the same entity → score = 1  
- Otherwise → score = 0  

---

**idx_0:**  
Response: ""$499/$599""  
Target: ""$499/$599""  
Exactly the same → 1

**idx_1:**  
Response: ""$199/$299""  
Target: ""$199/$299""  
Exactly the same → 1

**idx_2:**  
Response: ""$199/$299""  
Target: ""$99/$199/$299""  
Response lacks ""$99"", target has 3 prices, response has 2 but includes 2 of the target's 3. Not fully inclusive. Since the response is missing one price, it does not fully match the target, so likely 0.

**idx_3:**  
Response: ""$199/$299/$399""  
Target: ""$199/$299""  
Response has extra ""$399"". Since the response includes all prices of target (at least ""$199"" and ""$299"") plus one more price, the semantics point to the same entity with additional info. Since the criterion states ""approximately the same or point to the same entity"", extra items do not invalidate correctness. → 1

**idx_4:**  
Response: ""$199/$299""  
Target: ""$199/$299/$399""  
Response is missing ""$399"", so incomplete compared to target → 0

**idx_5:**  
Response: ""$199/$299/$349""  
Target: ""$199/$299/$399""  
Response differs in last item (""$349"" vs ""$399""). The set is similar but not same prices. Does this count? The criterion is semantic approximate same or pointing to the same entity. Here, price $349 instead of $399, the price points differ. These sets point to different prices and likely different products/pricing tiers, so → 0

**idx_6:**  
Same as idx_5: ""$199/$299/$349"" versus ""$199/$299/$399""  
→ 0

**idx_7:**  
Response: ""$199/$299/$449""  
Target: ""$199/$299/$399""  
Third price differs: $449 vs $399 → different prices → 0

**idx_8:**  
Response: ""$199/$299/$399""  
Target: ""$199/$299/$399""  
Exactly the same → 1

**idx_9:**  
Response: ""$399/$549/$649""  
Target: ""$649/$749/$849""  
No overlap except $649, but only one price overlap out of three, different ranges/prices → 0

**idx_10:**  
Response: ""$449/$649""  
Target: ""$699/$849""  
No overlap → 0

**idx_11:**  
Response: ""$999/$1,149""  
Target: ""$999/$1149""  
Highly similar, different formatting of 1,149 vs 1149. This is the same number → 1

**idx_12:**  
Response: ""$749/$849/$999""  
Target: ""$749/$799/$899""  
Overlap only in $749. Others differ ($849/$999 vs $799/$899). Price points differ, so likely → 0

**idx_13:**  
Response: ""$999/$1,149/$1,399""  
Target: ""$999/$1149/$1349""  
Compare prices: $999 matches, $1,149 vs $1149 same number, $1,399 vs $1349 differ by $50. Because the last price differs $1,399 vs $1,349, they are close but not identical. Given the margin might be considered different. Criterion: approximate semantics or same entities. The question is whether this $50 difference is acceptable as approximate? Probably not since prices have significance; slight difference may change tier or model. So 0

**idx_14:**  
Response: ""$399/$449/$549""  
Target: ""$699/$749/$849""  
No overlap → 0

**idx_15:**  
Response: ""$999/$1,099/$1,299""  
Target: ""$999/$1149/$1349""  
Compare prices: $999 matches; $1,099 vs $1149 differ by $50; $1,299 vs $1,349 also differ by $50. Differences here in second and third price points. Similar analysis as idx_13 → 0

**idx_16:**  
Response: ""$799/$849/$1,049""  
Target: ""$799/$849/$949""  
Difference at third price: $1,049 vs $949 differs by $100. Prices differ noticeably → 0

**idx_17:**  
Response: ""$799/$849/$1,099""  
Target: ""$799/$899/$1099""  
Compare prices: $799 exact; $849 vs $899 differ by $50; $1,099 vs $1099 same number.

The second price differs $849 vs $899. Different price points mean different pricing tiers. → 0

**idx_18:**  
Response: ""$799/$899/$1,099""  
Target: ""$799/$899/$1099""  
Difference only in formatting ""$1,099"" vs ""$1099"" same value → 1

**idx_19:**  
Response: ""$799/$899/$1,099""  
Target: ""$799/$899/$1099""  
Same as idx_18 → 1

- idx_3: response = ""8gb/16gb/32gb"", target = ""16gb/32gb""  
  Response contains target plus one more (8gb), which is close and points to same entities with some redundancy. This should count as sufficiently same → score = 1

  They mostly overlap on 16gb and 128gb but differ on the middle element. According to criterion, the semantics should be approximately the same or point to the same entity set. Here the middle entity differs (32gb vs 64gb). Given that other elements are correct but the middle one is different, this does not fully match.

**idx_0:**  
Response: ""$499/$599""  
Target: ""$499/$599""  
Exactly the same → 1

**idx_1:**  
Response: ""$199/$299""  
Target: ""$199/$299""  
Exactly the same → 1

**idx_2:**  
Response: ""$199/$299""  
Target: ""$99/$199/$299""  
Response lacks ""$99"", target has 3 prices, response has 2 but includes 2 of the target's 3. Not fully inclusive. Since the response is missing one price, it does not fully match the target, so likely 0.

**idx_3:**  
Response: ""$199/$299/$399""  
Target: ""$199/$299""  
Response has extra ""$399"". Since the response includes all prices of target (at least ""$199"" and ""$299"") plus one more price, the semantics point to the same entity with additional info. Since the criterion states ""approximately the same or point to the same entity"", extra items do not invalidate correctness. → 1

**idx_4:**  
Response: ""$199/$299""  
Target: ""$199/$299/$399""  
Response is missing ""$399"", so incomplete compared to target → 0

**idx_5:**  
Response: ""$199/$299/$349""  
Target: ""$199/$299/$399""  
Response differs in last item (""$349"" vs ""$399""). The set is similar but not same prices. Does this count? The criterion is semantic approximate same or pointing to the same entity. Here, price $349 instead of $399, the price points differ. These sets point to different prices and likely different products/pricing tiers, so → 0

**idx_6:**  
Same as idx_5: ""$199/$299/$349"" versus ""$199/$299/$399""  
→ 0

**idx_7:**  
Response: ""$199/$299/$449""  
Target: ""$199/$299/$399""  
Third price differs: $449 vs $399 → different prices → 0

**idx_8:**

Exactly the same → 1

**idx_9:**  
Response: ""$399/$549/$649""

No overlap → 0

**idx_11:**  
Response: ""$999/$1,149""  
Target: ""$999/$1149""  
Highly similar, different formatting of 1,149 vs 1149. This is the same number → 1

**idx_12:**  
Response: ""$749/$849/$999""  
Target: ""$749/$799/$899""  
Overlap only in $749. Others differ ($849/$999 vs $799/$899). Price points differ, so likely → 0

**idx_13:**  
Response: ""$999/$1,149/$1,399""  
Target: ""$999/$1149/$1349""  
Compare prices: $999 matches, $1,149 vs $1149 same number, $1,399 vs $1349 differ by $50. Because the last price differs $1,399 vs $1,349, they are close but not identical. Given the margin might be considered different. Criterion: approximate semantics or same entities. The question is whether this $50 difference is acceptable as approximate? Probably not since prices have significance; slight difference may change tier or model. So 0

**idx_14:**  
Response: ""$399/$449/$549""  
Target: ""$699/$749/$849""  
No overlap → 0

**idx_15:**

Compare prices: $999 matches; $1,099 vs $1149 differ by $50; $1,299 vs $1,349 also differ by $50. Differences here in second and third price points. Similar analysis as idx_13 → 0

**idx_16:**

Target: ""$799/$899/$1099""  
Compare prices: $799 exact; $849 vs $899 differ by $50; $1,099 vs $1099 same number.

The second price differs $849 vs $899. Different price points mean different pricing tiers. → 0

**idx_18:**  
Response: ""$799/$899/$1,099""  
Target: ""$799/$899/$1099""  
Difference only in formatting ""$1,099"" vs ""$1099"" same value → 1

Criterion: It is sufficient if the semantics are approximately the same as the reference answer or if they point to the same entity.

---

- idx_0: response = ""4gb/8gb"", target = ""4gb/8gb""  
  Exact match → score = 1

- idx_1: response = ""4gb/8gb"", target = ""8gb/16gb""  
  Different sets, no overlap → score = 0

- idx_2: response = ""8gb/16gb"", target = ""8gb/16gb/32gb""  
  Response is a subset of target, semantics basically same (points to mostly the same entities) → score = 1

- idx_3: response = ""8gb/16gb/32gb"", target = ""16gb/32gb""  
  Response contains target plus one more (8gb), which is close and points to same entities with some redundancy. This should count as sufficiently same → score = 1

- idx_4: response = ""16gb/32gb"", target = ""16gb/32gb/64gb""

- idx_8: response = ""16gb/32gb/128gb"", target = ""16gb/64gb/128gb""  
  Response has 32gb while target has 64gb, so differs in the middle value.  
  They mostly overlap on 16gb and 128gb but differ on the middle element. According to criterion, the semantics should be approximately the same or point to the same entity set. Here the middle entity differs (32gb vs 64gb). Given that other elements are correct but the middle one is different, this does not fully match.

**idx_0**  
Response: ""firsttofeaturea3.5-inchmulti-touchdisplay""  
Target: ""revolutionarymodelwithtouchscreendesign""  
Analysis: Both refer to introducing a touchscreen design on the phone. Response points to the first phone with a 3.5-inch multi-touch display, which fits ""revolutionary model with touchscreen design.""  
Score: 1

---

**idx_1**  
Response: ""firsttofeatureedge,laterto3g""  
Target: ""supportfor3gnetwork,appstorelaunched""  
Analysis: Response says ""first to feature edge (network), later to 3g""; target focuses on 3G support and App Store launch. Edge network and 3G are related but distinct generations; ""later to 3g"" does not confirm 3G support matching target. Also, no mention of App Store. Semantics differ enough.  
Score: 0

---

**idx_3**  
Response: ""firsttofeatureretinadisplay""  
Target: ""retinadisplay,firstledflash""  
Analysis: Response mentions first retina display; target mentions retina display and first LED flash. Response covers retina display, which matches partly, ignoring LED flash. Since retina display is covered, semantics are approximately the same.  
Score: 1

---

**idx_4**  
Response: ""firsttofeaturesiri""  
Target: ""introductionofsirivoiceassistant""  
Analysis: ""siri"" vs ""siri voice assistant"" are the same entity; minor spelling difference (""siri"" vs ""siri"") is acceptable.

**idx_8**  
Response: ""firsttofeature3dtouch""  
Target: ""introductionof3dtouchtechnology""  
Analysis: Same thing, worded differently but semantically identical.  
Score: 1

---

**idx_9**  
Response: ""water-resistant,firsttofeaturewirelesscharging""  
Target: ""removed3.5mmheadphonejack,ip67wateranddustresistance""  
Analysis: Response mentions water resistance and wireless charging. Target mentions removal of headphone jack and IP67 water resistance. Water resistance matches partially but response mentions wireless charging which is not in target. Since the removal headphone jack is missing and wireless charging is additional, approximate but partially overlapping. Given criterion says ""approximate semantics are sufficient""—since both mention water resistance, and wireless charging is another positive feature, this is arguably close enough.  
Score: 1

**idx_10**  
Response: ""firsttofeaturewirelesscharging,ceramicshieldglass""  
Target: ""glassbackwithwirelesscharging""  
Analysis: Both mention wireless charging with glass. Response adds ceramic shield glass, which is additional detail. Semantically consistent.

**idx_1**  
Response: ""firsttofeatureedge,laterto3g""  
Target: ""supportfor3gnetwork,appstorelaunched""  
Analysis: Response says ""first to feature edge (network), later to 3g""; target focuses on 3G support and App Store launch. Edge network and 3G are related but distinct generations; ""later to 3g"" does not confirm 3G support matching target. Also, no mention of App Store. Semantics differ enough.

**idx_9**  
Response: ""water-resistant,firsttofeaturewirelesscharging""  
Target: ""removed3.5mmheadphonejack,ip67wateranddustresistance""  
Analysis: Response mentions water resistance and wireless charging. Target mentions removal of headphone jack and IP67 water resistance. Water resistance matches partially but response mentions wireless charging which is not in target. Since the removal headphone jack is missing and wireless charging is additional, approximate but partially overlapping. Given criterion says ""approximate semantics are sufficient""—since both mention water resistance, and wireless charging is another positive feature, this is arguably close enough.  
Score: 1

- Semantics approximately the same or point to the same entity → score = 1  
- Otherwise → score = 0  

---

**idx_0:**  
Response: ""$499/$599""  
Target: ""$499/$599""  
Exactly the same → 1

**idx_1:**  
Response: ""$199/$299""  
Target: ""$199/$299""  
Exactly the same → 1

**idx_2:**  
Response: ""$199/$299""  
Target: ""$99/$199/$299""  
Response lacks ""$99"", target has 3 prices, response has 2 but includes 2 of the target's 3. Not fully inclusive. Since the response is missing one price, it does not fully match the target, so likely 0.

**idx_3:**  
Response: ""$199/$299/$399""  
Target: ""$199/$299""  
Response has extra ""$399"". Since the response includes all prices of target (at least ""$199"" and ""$299"") plus one more price, the semantics point to the same entity with additional info. Since the criterion states ""approximately the same or point to the same entity"", extra items do not invalidate correctness. → 1

**idx_4:**  
Response: ""$199/$299""  
Target: ""$199/$299/$399""  
Response is missing ""$399"", so incomplete compared to target → 0

**idx_5:**  
Response: ""$199/$299/$349""  
Target: ""$199/$299/$399""  
Response differs in last item (""$349"" vs ""$399""). The set is similar but not same prices. Does this count? The criterion is semantic approximate same or pointing to the same entity. Here, price $349 instead of $399, the price points differ. These sets point to different prices and likely different products/pricing tiers, so → 0

**idx_6:**  
Same as idx_5: ""$199/$299/$349"" versus ""$199/$299/$399""  
→ 0

**idx_7:**  
Response: ""$199/$299/$449""  
Target: ""$199/$299/$399""  
Third price differs: $449 vs $399 → different prices → 0

**idx_8:**  
Response: ""$199/$299/$399""  
Target: ""$199/$299/$399""  
Exactly the same → 1

**idx_9:**  
Response: ""$399/$549/$649""  
Target: ""$649/$749/$849""  
No overlap except $649, but only one price overlap out of three, different ranges/prices → 0

**idx_10:**  
Response: ""$449/$649""  
Target: ""$699/$849""  
No overlap → 0

**idx_11:**  
Response: ""$999/$1,149""  
Target: ""$999/$1149""  
Highly similar, different formatting of 1,149 vs 1149. This is the same number → 1

**idx_12:**  
Response: ""$749/$849/$999""  
Target: ""$749/$799/$899""  
Overlap only in $749. Others differ ($849/$999 vs $799/$899). Price points differ, so likely → 0

**idx_13:**  
Response: ""$999/$1,149/$1,399""  
Target: ""$999/$1149/$1349""  
Compare prices: $999 matches, $1,149 vs $1149 same number, $1,399 vs $1349 differ by $50. Because the last price differs $1,399 vs $1,349, they are close but not identical. Given the margin might be considered different. Criterion: approximate semantics or same entities. The question is whether this $50 difference is acceptable as approximate? Probably not since prices have significance; slight difference may change tier or model. So 0

**idx_14:**  
Response: ""$399/$449/$549""  
Target: ""$699/$749/$849""  
No overlap → 0

**idx_15:**  
Response: ""$999/$1,099/$1,299""  
Target: ""$999/$1149/$1349""  
Compare prices: $999 matches; $1,099 vs $1149 differ by $50; $1,299 vs $1,349 also differ by $50. Differences here in second and third price points. Similar analysis as idx_13 → 0

**idx_16:**  
Response: ""$799/$849/$1,049""  
Target: ""$799/$849/$949""  
Difference at third price: $1,049 vs $949 differs by $100. Prices differ noticeably → 0

**idx_17:**  
Response: ""$799/$849/$1,099""  
Target: ""$799/$899/$1099""  
Compare prices: $799 exact; $849 vs $899 differ by $50; $1,099 vs $1099 same number.

The second price differs $849 vs $899. Different price points mean different pricing tiers. → 0

**idx_18:**  
Response: ""$799/$899/$1,099""  
Target: ""$799/$899/$1099""  
Difference only in formatting ""$1,099"" vs ""$1099"" same value → 1

**idx_19:**

Response: ""water-resistant,firsttofeaturewirelesscharging""  
Target: ""removed3.5mmheadphonejack,ip67wateranddustresistance""  
Analysis: Response mentions water resistance and wireless charging. Target mentions removal of headphone jack and IP67 water resistance. Water resistance matches partially but response mentions wireless charging which is not in target. Since the removal headphone jack is missing and wireless charging is additional, approximate but partially overlapping. Given criterion says ""approximate semantics are sufficient""—since both mention water resistance, and wireless charging is another positive feature, this is arguably close enough.

**idx_0:**  
Response: ""$499/$599""  
Target: ""$499/$599""  
Exactly the same → 1

**idx_1:**  
Response: ""$199/$299""  
Target: ""$199/$299""  
Exactly the same → 1

**idx_2:**  
Response: ""$199/$299""  
Target: ""$99/$199/$299""  
Response lacks ""$99"", target has 3 prices, response has 2 but includes 2 of the target's 3. Not fully inclusive. Since the response is missing one price, it does not fully match the target, so likely 0.

**idx_3:**  
Response: ""$199/$299/$399""  
Target: ""$199/$299""  
Response has extra ""$399"". Since the response includes all prices of target (at least ""$199"" and ""$299"") plus one more price, the semantics point to the same entity with additional info. Since the criterion states ""approximately the same or point to the same entity"", extra items do not invalidate correctness. → 1

**idx_4:**  
Response: ""$199/$299""  
Target: ""$199/$299/$399""  
Response is missing ""$399"", so incomplete compared to target → 0

**idx_5:**  
Response: ""$199/$299/$349""  
Target: ""$199/$299/$399""  
Response differs in last item (""$349"" vs ""$399""). The set is similar but not same prices. Does this count? The criterion is semantic approximate same or pointing to the same entity. Here, price $349 instead of $399, the price points differ. These sets point to different prices and likely different products/pricing tiers, so → 0

**idx_6:**  
Same as idx_5: ""$199/$299/$349"" versus ""$199/$299/$399""  
→ 0

**idx_7:**  
Response: ""$199/$299/$449""  
Target: ""$199/$299/$399""  
Third price differs: $449 vs $399 → different prices → 0

**idx_8:**  
Response: ""$199/$299/$399""  
Target: ""$199/$299/$399""  
Exactly the same → 1

**idx_9:**  
Response: ""$399/$549/$649""  
Target: ""$649/$749/$849""  
No overlap except $649, but only one price overlap out of three, different ranges/prices → 0

**idx_10:**  
Response: ""$449/$649""  
Target: ""$699/$849""  
No overlap → 0

**idx_11:**  
Response: ""$999/$1,149""  
Target: ""$999/$1149""  
Highly similar, different formatting of 1,149 vs 1149. This is the same number → 1

**idx_12:**  
Response: ""$749/$849/$999""  
Target: ""$749/$799/$899""  
Overlap only in $749. Others differ ($849/$999 vs $799/$899). Price points differ, so likely → 0

**idx_13:**  
Response: ""$999/$1,149/$1,399""  
Target: ""$999/$1149/$1349""  
Compare prices: $999 matches, $1,149 vs $1149 same number, $1,399 vs $1349 differ by $50. Because the last price differs $1,399 vs $1,349, they are close but not identical. Given the margin might be considered different. Criterion: approximate semantics or same entities. The question is whether this $50 difference is acceptable as approximate? Probably not since prices have significance; slight difference may change tier or model. So 0

**idx_14:**  
Response: ""$399/$449/$549""  
Target: ""$699/$749/$849""  
No overlap → 0

**idx_15:**  
Response: ""$999/$1,099/$1,299""

Compare prices: $999 matches; $1,099 vs $1149 differ by $50; $1,299 vs $1,349 also differ by $50. Differences here in second and third price points. Similar analysis as idx_13 → 0

**idx_16:**  
Response: ""$799/$849/$1,049""

Target: ""$799/$899/$1099""  
Compare prices: $799 exact; $849 vs $899 differ by $50; $1,099 vs $1099 same number.

The second price differs $849 vs $899. Different price points mean different pricing tiers. → 0

**idx_18:**

- idx_3: response = ""8gb/16gb/32gb"", target = ""16gb/32gb""  
  Response contains target plus one more (8gb), which is close and points to same entities with some redundancy. This should count as sufficiently same → score = 1

  Response has 32gb while target has 64gb, so differs in the middle value.  
  They mostly overlap on 16gb and 128gb but differ on the middle element. According to criterion, the semantics should be approximately the same or point to the same entity set. Here the middle entity differs (32gb vs 64gb). Given that other elements are correct but the middle one is different, this does not fully match.

Compare prices: $999 matches, $1,149 vs $1149 same number, $1,399 vs $1349 differ by $50. Because the last price differs $1,399 vs $1,349, they are close but not identical. Given the margin might be considered different. Criterion: approximate semantics or same entities. The question is whether this $50 difference is acceptable as approximate? Probably not since prices have significance; slight difference may change tier or model. So 0

,,iphone16,iPhone 16,1.0,"Let's analyze each idx one by one based on the criterion:

Criterion: It is sufficient if the semantics are approximately the same as the reference answer or if they point to the same entity.

---

- idx_0: response = ""4gb/8gb"", target = ""4gb/8gb""  
  Exact match → score = 1

- idx_1: response = ""4gb/8gb"", target = ""8gb/16gb""  
  Different sets, no overlap → score = 0

- idx_2: response = ""8gb/16gb"", target = ""8gb/16gb/32gb""  
  Response is a subset of target, semantics basically same (points to mostly the same entities) → score = 1

- idx_3: response = ""8gb/16gb/32gb"", target = ""16gb/32gb""  
  Response contains target plus one more (8gb), which is close and points to same entities with some redundancy. This should count as sufficiently same → score = 1

- idx_4: response = ""16gb/32gb"", target = ""16gb/32gb/64gb""  
  Response is subset of target, semantics approximately same → score = 1

- idx_5: response = ""16gb/32gb/64gb"", target = ""16gb/32gb/64gb""

- idx_7: response = ""16gb/64gb/128gb"", target = ""16gb/64gb/128gb""  
  Exact match → score = 1

- idx_8: response = ""16gb/32gb/128gb"", target = ""16gb/64gb/128gb""  
  Response has 32gb while target has 64gb, so differs in the middle value.  
  They mostly overlap on 16gb and 128gb but differ on the middle element. According to criterion, the semantics should be approximately the same or point to the same entity set. Here the middle entity differs (32gb vs 64gb). Given that other elements are correct but the middle one is different, this does not fully match.

**idx_0**  
Response: ""firsttofeaturea3.5-inchmulti-touchdisplay""  
Target: ""revolutionarymodelwithtouchscreendesign""  
Analysis: Both refer to introducing a touchscreen design on the phone. Response points to the first phone with a 3.5-inch multi-touch display, which fits ""revolutionary model with touchscreen design.""  
Score: 1

---

**idx_1**  
Response: ""firsttofeatureedge,laterto3g""  
Target: ""supportfor3gnetwork,appstorelaunched""  
Analysis: Response says ""first to feature edge (network), later to 3g""; target focuses on 3G support and App Store launch. Edge network and 3G are related but distinct generations; ""later to 3g"" does not confirm 3G support matching target. Also, no mention of App Store. Semantics differ enough.  
Score: 0

**idx_2**  
Response: ""firsttofeaturecamerawithflash""

---

**idx_3**  
Response: ""firsttofeatureretinadisplay""  
Target: ""retinadisplay,firstledflash""  
Analysis: Response mentions first retina display; target mentions retina display and first LED flash. Response covers retina display, which matches partly, ignoring LED flash. Since retina display is covered, semantics are approximately the same.  
Score: 1

---

**idx_4**  
Response: ""firsttofeaturesiri""  
Target: ""introductionofsirivoiceassistant""  
Analysis: ""siri"" vs ""siri voice assistant"" are the same entity; minor spelling difference (""siri"" vs ""siri"") is acceptable.  
Score: 1

**idx_8**  
Response: ""firsttofeature3dtouch""  
Target: ""introductionof3dtouchtechnology""  
Analysis: Same thing, worded differently but semantically identical.  
Score: 1

---

**idx_9**  
Response: ""water-resistant,firsttofeaturewirelesscharging""  
Target: ""removed3.5mmheadphonejack,ip67wateranddustresistance""  
Analysis: Response mentions water resistance and wireless charging. Target mentions removal of headphone jack and IP67 water resistance. Water resistance matches partially but response mentions wireless charging which is not in target. Since the removal headphone jack is missing and wireless charging is additional, approximate but partially overlapping. Given criterion says ""approximate semantics are sufficient""—since both mention water resistance, and wireless charging is another positive feature, this is arguably close enough.  
Score: 1

**idx_10**  
Response: ""firsttofeaturewirelesscharging,ceramicshieldglass""  
Target: ""glassbackwithwirelesscharging""  
Analysis: Both mention wireless charging with glass. Response adds ceramic shield glass, which is additional detail. Semantically consistent.

- Semantics approximately the same or point to the same entity → score = 1  
- Otherwise → score = 0  

---

**idx_0:**  
Response: ""$499/$599""  
Target: ""$499/$599""  
Exactly the same → 1

**idx_1:**  
Response: ""$199/$299""  
Target: ""$199/$299""  
Exactly the same → 1

**idx_2:**  
Response: ""$199/$299""  
Target: ""$99/$199/$299""  
Response lacks ""$99"", target has 3 prices, response has 2 but includes 2 of the target's 3. Not fully inclusive. Since the response is missing one price, it does not fully match the target, so likely 0.

**idx_3:**  
Response: ""$199/$299/$399""  
Target: ""$199/$299""  
Response has extra ""$399"". Since the response includes all prices of target (at least ""$199"" and ""$299"") plus one more price, the semantics point to the same entity with additional info. Since the criterion states ""approximately the same or point to the same entity"", extra items do not invalidate correctness. → 1

**idx_4:**  
Response: ""$199/$299""  
Target: ""$199/$299/$399""  
Response is missing ""$399"", so incomplete compared to target → 0

**idx_5:**  
Response: ""$199/$299/$349""  
Target: ""$199/$299/$399""  
Response differs in last item (""$349"" vs ""$399""). The set is similar but not same prices. Does this count? The criterion is semantic approximate same or pointing to the same entity. Here, price $349 instead of $399, the price points differ. These sets point to different prices and likely different products/pricing tiers, so → 0

**idx_6:**  
Same as idx_5: ""$199/$299/$349"" versus ""$199/$299/$399""  
→ 0

**idx_7:**  
Response: ""$199/$299/$449""  
Target: ""$199/$299/$399""  
Third price differs: $449 vs $399 → different prices → 0

**idx_8:**  
Response: ""$199/$299/$399""  
Target: ""$199/$299/$399""  
Exactly the same → 1

**idx_9:**  
Response: ""$399/$549/$649""  
Target: ""$649/$749/$849""  
No overlap except $649, but only one price overlap out of three, different ranges/prices → 0

**idx_10:**  
Response: ""$449/$649""  
Target: ""$699/$849""  
No overlap → 0

**idx_11:**  
Response: ""$999/$1,149""  
Target: ""$999/$1149""  
Highly similar, different formatting of 1,149 vs 1149. This is the same number → 1

**idx_12:**  
Response: ""$749/$849/$999""  
Target: ""$749/$799/$899""  
Overlap only in $749. Others differ ($849/$999 vs $799/$899). Price points differ, so likely → 0

**idx_13:**  
Response: ""$999/$1,149/$1,399""  
Target: ""$999/$1149/$1349""  
Compare prices: $999 matches, $1,149 vs $1149 same number, $1,399 vs $1349 differ by $50. Because the last price differs $1,399 vs $1,349, they are close but not identical. Given the margin might be considered different. Criterion: approximate semantics or same entities. The question is whether this $50 difference is acceptable as approximate? Probably not since prices have significance; slight difference may change tier or model. So 0

**idx_14:**  
Response: ""$399/$449/$549""  
Target: ""$699/$749/$849""  
No overlap → 0

**idx_15:**  
Response: ""$999/$1,099/$1,299""  
Target: ""$999/$1149/$1349""  
Compare prices: $999 matches; $1,099 vs $1149 differ by $50; $1,299 vs $1,349 also differ by $50. Differences here in second and third price points. Similar analysis as idx_13 → 0

**idx_16:**  
Response: ""$799/$849/$1,049""  
Target: ""$799/$849/$949""
