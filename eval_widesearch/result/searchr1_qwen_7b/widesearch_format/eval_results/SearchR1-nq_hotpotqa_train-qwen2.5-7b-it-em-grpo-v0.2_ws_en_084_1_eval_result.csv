,,2018/02/14,2018/02/14,0.0,"Let's analyze the provided item step by step.

---

**Input:**

- idx: 0
- response: ""notprovided""
- target (standard answer): ""19""

---

**Grading criterion:**

- It is sufficient if the semantics are approximately the same or if they point to the same entity.
- No need for word-for-word correspondence.
- Score is either 0 or 1.

---

**Analysis:**

- Target answer is ""19"" (assumed to be a numeric or categorical answer).
- Response is ""notprovided"" which basically means no answer or a placeholder that does not correspond semantically to ""19"".
- So, the response does not meet the criterion of pointing to the same entity or semantic equivalence.

Therefore, the appropriate score is 0.

```",19,notprovided,0.0,"number not near, response: 2.0, target: 17.0",17,2,0.0,"First, let's analyze the provided information step by step.

### Given:
- **idx_0:**  
  - **Response:** ""notprovided""  
  - **Target (Standard Answer):** ""formerstudent(expelled)""

### Criterion:
- **Sufficient if semantics are approximately the same or if they point to the same entity. No need for exact word-for-word match.**

### Analysis:
- The target answer clearly identifies a specific semantic concept: ""formerstudent(expelled),"" which means the person was a student but was expelled.
- The response is ""notprovided,"" meaning no answer or the response does not provide any information related to the target.
- Since ""notprovided"" has no semantic similarity or correspondence to ""formerstudent(expelled),"" it does not meet the criterion of matching or pointing to the same entity.

### Conclusion:
- The response does not satisfy the requirement.
- Score: 0

```json

    ""idx_0"": 0

```",formerstudent(expelled),notprovided,1.0,key_match,0.0,"Let's analyze the response against the target according to the criterion:

- Target: ""marjorystonemandouglashighschool,parkland""
- Response: ""saddlebackcollege""

The criterion states that the semantics need only be approximately the same or pointing to the same entity. Here:

- The response names a completely different educational institution (""saddlebackcollege"") compared to the target (""marjorystonemandouglashighschool"" and ""parkland"").
- These are distinct schools; the response does not match or point to the same entity or entities.
- There is no semantic equivalence or approximate match.

Therefore, the response does not meet the criterion.

Final score for idx_0: 0

```json
{
    ""idx_0"": 0
}
```","marjorystonemandouglashighschool,parkland",saddlebackcollege,0.0,"Let's analyze the given pair according to the criterion:

- Standard answer: ""lifeimprisonmentwithoutparole""
- Response: ""notprovided""

Criterion says: The response must have approximately the same semantics or point to the same entity as the reference answer. No need for word-for-word match, but the meaning or entity should be matched.

Step-by-step analysis:

1. The reference answer clearly refers to a specific sentence type: ""life imprisonment without parole"".
2. The response is ""notprovided"", which does not attempt to match or hint at the same meaning or entity.
3. Therefore, the response does not satisfy the criterion.

Final scoring is 0.

- Standard answer: ""nikolascruz""
- Response: ""pauljosephciancia""
- Criterion: It is sufficient if the semantics are approximately the same as the reference answer or if they point to the same entity; no need for word-for-word correspondence.

Analysis:
- The response name ""pauljosephciancia"" is a completely different person/entity than ""nikolascruz.""
- The semantics are not approximately the same, and the entity pointed to is different.
- Therefore, the response does not match the standard answer.

Final scoring result for idx_0 is 0.

- Standard answer (target): ""florida""
- Response: ""california""
- Analysis: The standard answer and response refer to different entities/states. They do not have approximately the same semantics and do not point to the same entity.

According to the criterion, the score must be 0 or 1, with 1 indicating a completely correct answer.

Final score for idx_0 is 0.
