Criterion:  
- It is sufficient if the semantics are approximately the same as the reference answer or if they point to the same entity.  
- No need for word-for-word correspondence.

### idx_0  
- Response: ""cgon""  
- Target: ""cgon""  
- Analysis: The response exactly matches the target.  
- Score: 1

### idx_1  
- Response: ""zbio""  
- Target: ""zbio""  
- Analysis: The response exactly matches the target.  
- Score: 1

### idx_2  
- Response: ""upst""  
- Target: ""upb""  
- Analysis: The response and target strings are different (""upst"" vs ""upb"").  
- Is there approximate semantic equivalence or pointing to the same entity? It is not indicated they are the same or interchangeable abbreviations/entities.  
- Without further context, ""upst"" and ""upb"" seem different.  
- Score: 0

### idx_3  
- Response: ""mxbs""  
- Target: ""mbx""  
- Analysis: The response and target share similar characters but arranged differently (""mxbs"" vs. ""mbx"").  
- Are these the same entity or have approximate same semantics? It is not clearly indicated. By pure string difference and no other semantic clues, consider them different entities.  
- Score: 0
