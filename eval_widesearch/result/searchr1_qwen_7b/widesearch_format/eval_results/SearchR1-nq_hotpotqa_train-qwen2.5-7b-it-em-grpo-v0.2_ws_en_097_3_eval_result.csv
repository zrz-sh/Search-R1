,,tokyoraiders,Tokyo Raiders,1.0,"Let's analyze each idx pair carefully according to the criteria.

---

### idx_0

- **Response:** ""-""
- **Target:** ""-""

Analysis: Both response and target are ""-"", indicating no content or both are empty or irrelevant. Since semantics approximately match (both indicate no meaningful answer), the score should be 1.

---

### idx_1

- **Response:** ""bestactor""
- **Target:** 
  ```
  the22ndhongkongfilmawards:wonbestactor
  the40thgoldenhorseawards:wonbestactor
  the8thhongkonggoldenbauhiniaawards:wonbestactor
  silverawardformostpopularactoratthe3rdchinesefilmmediaawards
  ```

Analysis: The target lists multiple awards won for best actor and a silver award for most popular actor.

The response ""bestactor"" is very general and only mentions ""bestactor."" The criterion says ""It is sufficient if the semantics are approximately the same or point to the same entity.""

Here the response points generally to the same entity: best actor awards.

Given that the response is less detailed but the criterion allows approximate semantics pointing to the same entity, ""bestactor"" relates to the best actor awards the target listed.

Hence, score = 1.

---

### idx_2

- **Response:** ""bestdirector""
- **Target:** ""-""

Analysis: The target is ""-"", meaning no relevant answer or no awards for best director.

The response ""bestdirector"" states something not in the target and is not semantically approximate or matching.

Hence, score = 0.

---

### Final scoring results:

```json

  ""idx_0"": 1,
  ""idx_1"": 1,
  ""idx_2"": 0
}
```",-,-,0.0,"Let's analyze each pair step by step based on the criterion:  
- The semantics are approximately the same or point to the same entity.  
- No need for word-for-word correspondence.

**idx_0**  
- Response: ""peterchan""  
- Target: ""jinglema""  
Analysis: The two names are different and do not point to the same entity. No approximate semantic equivalence.  
Score: 0

---

**idx_1**  
- Response: ""alanmak,andrewlau""  
- Target: ""andrewlau，alanmak""  
Analysis: Despite the order difference and different punctuation (comma vs. Chinese comma), the two contain exactly the same names/people, hence semantics match and point to the same entities.

**idx_2**  
- Response: ""zhangyimou""
