,,1,1,2015,2015,0.0,"Let's analyze each idx according to the criteria:

Criterion summary: 
- Semantics approximately the same or pointing to the same entity qualifies for score 1.
- Only exact matching or equivalent entities count as correct.
- If response and target are different entities/artists, score 0.

",markronsonfeaturingbrunomars,theweeknd,1.0,key_match,0.0,"Let's analyze each pair (response vs target) according to the grading criterion:

Criterion:  
- ""It is sufficient if the semantics are approximately the same as the reference answer or if they point to the same entity.""  
- No need for word-for-word correspondence. So basically if the response is the same song title as the target (ignoring casing, spacing, minor punctuation), score = 1; else 0.

Note: Song titles in the responses and targets are mostly lowercase, no spaces or apostrophes etc. So we just check exact matching ignoring apostrophes or special characters could be permitted, but tokens here are close enough.

",edsheeran,zeddfeaturingmarenmorris,1.0,key_match,0.0,"Let's analyze each pair (response vs target) according to the grading criterion:

Criterion:  
- ""It is sufficient if the semantics are approximately the same as the reference answer or if they point to the same entity.""  
- No need for word-for-word correspondence. So basically if the response is the same song title as the target (ignoring casing, spacing, minor punctuation), score = 1; else 0.

Note: Song titles in the responses and targets are mostly lowercase, no spaces or apostrophes etc. So we just check exact matching ignoring apostrophes or special characters could be permitted, but tokens here are close enough.

",wizkhalifafeaturingcharlieputh,theweeknd,1.0,key_match,0.0,"Let's analyze each pair (response vs target) according to the grading criterion:

Criterion:  
- ""It is sufficient if the semantics are approximately the same as the reference answer or if they point to the same entity.""  
- No need for word-for-word correspondence. So basically if the response is the same song title as the target (ignoring casing, spacing, minor punctuation), score = 1; else 0.

Note: Song titles in the responses and targets are mostly lowercase, no spaces or apostrophes etc. So we just check exact matching ignoring apostrophes or special characters could be permitted, but tokens here are close enough.

",fettywap,omi,1.0,key_match,0.0,"Let's analyze each pair (response vs target) according to the grading criterion:

Criterion:  
- ""It is sufficient if the semantics are approximately the same as the reference answer or if they point to the same entity.""  
- No need for word-for-word correspondence. So basically if the response is the same song title as the target (ignoring casing, spacing, minor punctuation), score = 1; else 0.

Note: Song titles in the responses and targets are mostly lowercase, no spaces or apostrophes etc. So we just check exact matching ignoring apostrophes or special characters could be permitted, but tokens here are close enough.

",maroon5,katyperry,1.0,key_match,0.0,"Let's analyze each pair (response vs target) according to the grading criterion:

Criterion:  
- ""It is sufficient if the semantics are approximately the same as the reference answer or if they point to the same entity.""  
- No need for word-for-word correspondence. So basically if the response is the same song title as the target (ignoring casing, spacing, minor punctuation), score = 1; else 0.

Note: Song titles in the responses and targets are mostly lowercase, no spaces or apostrophes etc. So we just check exact matching ignoring apostrophes or special characters could be permitted, but tokens here are close enough.

",walkthemoon,rihanna,1.0,key_match,0.0,"Let's analyze each pair (response vs target) according to the grading criterion:

Criterion:  
- ""It is sufficient if the semantics are approximately the same as the reference answer or if they point to the same entity.""  
- No need for word-for-word correspondence. So basically if the response is the same song title as the target (ignoring casing, spacing, minor punctuation), score = 1; else 0.

Note: Song titles in the responses and targets are mostly lowercase, no spaces or apostrophes etc. So we just check exact matching ignoring apostrophes or special characters could be permitted, but tokens here are close enough.

",taylorswift,shakira,1.0,key_match,0.0,"Let's analyze each pair (response vs target) according to the grading criterion:

Criterion:  
- ""It is sufficient if the semantics are approximately the same as the reference answer or if they point to the same entity.""  
- No need for word-for-word correspondence. So basically if the response is the same song title as the target (ignoring casing, spacing, minor punctuation), score = 1; else 0.

Note: Song titles in the responses and targets are mostly lowercase, no spaces or apostrophes etc. So we just check exact matching ignoring apostrophes or special characters could be permitted, but tokens here are close enough.

",silentó,samsmith,1.0,key_match,0.0,"Let's analyze each pair (response vs target) according to the grading criterion:

Criterion:  
- ""It is sufficient if the semantics are approximately the same as the reference answer or if they point to the same entity.""  
- No need for word-for-word correspondence. So basically if the response is the same song title as the target (ignoring casing, spacing, minor punctuation), score = 1; else 0.

Note: Song titles in the responses and targets are mostly lowercase, no spaces or apostrophes etc. So we just check exact matching ignoring apostrophes or special characters could be permitted, but tokens here are close enough.

",theweeknd,mileycyrus,1.0,key_match,0.0,"Let's analyze each pair (response vs target) according to the grading criterion:

Criterion:  
- ""It is sufficient if the semantics are approximately the same as the reference answer or if they point to the same entity.""  
- No need for word-for-word correspondence. So basically if the response is the same song title as the target (ignoring casing, spacing, minor punctuation), score = 1; else 0.

Note: Song titles in the responses and targets are mostly lowercase, no spaces or apostrophes etc. So we just check exact matching ignoring apostrophes or special characters could be permitted, but tokens here are close enough.

",theweeknd,fifthharmony,1.0,key_match,0.0,"Let's analyze each pair (response vs target) according to the grading criterion:

Criterion:  
- ""It is sufficient if the semantics are approximately the same as the reference answer or if they point to the same entity.""  
- No need for word-for-word correspondence. So basically if the response is the same song title as the target (ignoring casing, spacing, minor punctuation), score = 1; else 0.

Note: Song titles in the responses and targets are mostly lowercase, no spaces or apostrophes etc. So we just check exact matching ignoring apostrophes or special characters could be permitted, but tokens here are close enough.

",justinbieber,rihanna,1.0,key_match,0.0,"Let's analyze each pair (response vs target) according to the grading criterion:

Criterion:  
- ""It is sufficient if the semantics are approximately the same as the reference answer or if they point to the same entity.""  
- No need for word-for-word correspondence. So basically if the response is the same song title as the target (ignoring casing, spacing, minor punctuation), score = 1; else 0.

Note: Song titles in the responses and targets are mostly lowercase, no spaces or apostrophes etc. So we just check exact matching ignoring apostrophes or special characters could be permitted, but tokens here are close enough.

",justinbieber,justinbieber,1.0,key_match,1.0,"Let's analyze each pair (response vs target) according to the grading criterion:

Criterion:  
- ""It is sufficient if the semantics are approximately the same as the reference answer or if they point to the same entity.""  
- No need for word-for-word correspondence. So basically if the response is the same song title as the target (ignoring casing, spacing, minor punctuation), score = 1; else 0.

Note: Song titles in the responses and targets are mostly lowercase, no spaces or apostrophes etc. So we just check exact matching ignoring apostrophes or special characters could be permitted, but tokens here are close enough.

",drakefeaturingwizkidandkyla,drake,1.0,key_match,1.0,"Let's analyze each pair (response vs target) according to the grading criterion:

Criterion:  
- ""It is sufficient if the semantics are approximately the same as the reference answer or if they point to the same entity.""  
- No need for word-for-word correspondence. So basically if the response is the same song title as the target (ignoring casing, spacing, minor punctuation), score = 1; else 0.

Note: Song titles in the responses and targets are mostly lowercase, no spaces or apostrophes etc. So we just check exact matching ignoring apostrophes or special characters could be permitted, but tokens here are close enough.

",rihannafeaturingdrake,shakira,1.0,key_match,0.0,"Let's analyze each pair (response vs target) according to the grading criterion:

Criterion:  
- ""It is sufficient if the semantics are approximately the same as the reference answer or if they point to the same entity.""  
- No need for word-for-word correspondence. So basically if the response is the same song title as the target (ignoring casing, spacing, minor punctuation), score = 1; else 0.

Note: Song titles in the responses and targets are mostly lowercase, no spaces or apostrophes etc. So we just check exact matching ignoring apostrophes or special characters could be permitted, but tokens here are close enough.

",twentyonepilots,twentyonepilots,1.0,key_match,1.0,"Let's analyze each pair (response vs target) according to the grading criterion:

Criterion:  
- ""It is sufficient if the semantics are approximately the same as the reference answer or if they point to the same entity.""  
- No need for word-for-word correspondence. So basically if the response is the same song title as the target (ignoring casing, spacing, minor punctuation), score = 1; else 0.

Note: Song titles in the responses and targets are mostly lowercase, no spaces or apostrophes etc. So we just check exact matching ignoring apostrophes or special characters could be permitted, but tokens here are close enough.

",desiigner,desiigner,1.0,key_match,1.0,"Let's analyze each pair (response vs target) according to the grading criterion:

Criterion:  
- ""It is sufficient if the semantics are approximately the same as the reference answer or if they point to the same entity.""  
- No need for word-for-word correspondence. So basically if the response is the same song title as the target (ignoring casing, spacing, minor punctuation), score = 1; else 0.

Note: Song titles in the responses and targets are mostly lowercase, no spaces or apostrophes etc. So we just check exact matching ignoring apostrophes or special characters could be permitted, but tokens here are close enough.

",adele,macklemore&ryanlewis,1.0,key_match,0.0,"Let's analyze each pair (response vs target) according to the grading criterion:

Criterion:  
- ""It is sufficient if the semantics are approximately the same as the reference answer or if they point to the same entity.""  
- No need for word-for-word correspondence. So basically if the response is the same song title as the target (ignoring casing, spacing, minor punctuation), score = 1; else 0.

Note: Song titles in the responses and targets are mostly lowercase, no spaces or apostrophes etc. So we just check exact matching ignoring apostrophes or special characters could be permitted, but tokens here are close enough.

",thechainsmokersfeaturingdaya,calvinharris,1.0,key_match,0.0,"Let's analyze each pair (response vs target) according to the grading criterion:

Criterion:  
- ""It is sufficient if the semantics are approximately the same as the reference answer or if they point to the same entity.""  
- No need for word-for-word correspondence. So basically if the response is the same song title as the target (ignoring casing, spacing, minor punctuation), score = 1; else 0.

Note: Song titles in the responses and targets are mostly lowercase, no spaces or apostrophes etc. So we just check exact matching ignoring apostrophes or special characters could be permitted, but tokens here are close enough.

",justintimberlake,zedd,1.0,key_match,0.0,"Let's analyze each pair (response vs target) according to the grading criterion:

Criterion:  
- ""It is sufficient if the semantics are approximately the same as the reference answer or if they point to the same entity.""  
- No need for word-for-word correspondence. So basically if the response is the same song title as the target (ignoring casing, spacing, minor punctuation), score = 1; else 0.

Note: Song titles in the responses and targets are mostly lowercase, no spaces or apostrophes etc. So we just check exact matching ignoring apostrophes or special characters could be permitted, but tokens here are close enough.

",thechainsmokersfeaturinghalsey,zedd,1.0,key_match,0.0,"Let's analyze each pair (response vs target) according to the grading criterion:

Criterion:  
- ""It is sufficient if the semantics are approximately the same as the reference answer or if they point to the same entity.""  
- No need for word-for-word correspondence. So basically if the response is the same song title as the target (ignoring casing, spacing, minor punctuation), score = 1; else 0.

Note: Song titles in the responses and targets are mostly lowercase, no spaces or apostrophes etc. So we just check exact matching ignoring apostrophes or special characters could be permitted, but tokens here are close enough.

",edsheeran,edsheeran,1.0,key_match,1.0,"Let's analyze each pair (response vs target) according to the grading criterion:

Criterion:  
- ""It is sufficient if the semantics are approximately the same as the reference answer or if they point to the same entity.""  
- No need for word-for-word correspondence. So basically if the response is the same song title as the target (ignoring casing, spacing, minor punctuation), score = 1; else 0.

Note: Song titles in the responses and targets are mostly lowercase, no spaces or apostrophes etc. So we just check exact matching ignoring apostrophes or special characters could be permitted, but tokens here are close enough.

",luisfonsianddaddyyankeefeaturingjustinbieber,luisfonsi&daddyyankee,1.0,key_match,1.0,"Let's analyze each pair (response vs target) according to the grading criterion:

Criterion:  
- ""It is sufficient if the semantics are approximately the same as the reference answer or if they point to the same entity.""  
- No need for word-for-word correspondence. So basically if the response is the same song title as the target (ignoring casing, spacing, minor punctuation), score = 1; else 0.

Note: Song titles in the responses and targets are mostly lowercase, no spaces or apostrophes etc. So we just check exact matching ignoring apostrophes or special characters could be permitted, but tokens here are close enough.

",brunomars,brunomars,1.0,key_match,1.0,"Let's analyze each pair (response vs target) according to the grading criterion:

Criterion:  
- ""It is sufficient if the semantics are approximately the same as the reference answer or if they point to the same entity.""  
- No need for word-for-word correspondence. So basically if the response is the same song title as the target (ignoring casing, spacing, minor punctuation), score = 1; else 0.

Note: Song titles in the responses and targets are mostly lowercase, no spaces or apostrophes etc. So we just check exact matching ignoring apostrophes or special characters could be permitted, but tokens here are close enough.

",kendricklamar,justinbieber,1.0,key_match,0.0,"Let's analyze each pair (response vs target) according to the grading criterion:

Criterion:  
- ""It is sufficient if the semantics are approximately the same as the reference answer or if they point to the same entity.""  
- No need for word-for-word correspondence. So basically if the response is the same song title as the target (ignoring casing, spacing, minor punctuation), score = 1; else 0.

Note: Song titles in the responses and targets are mostly lowercase, no spaces or apostrophes etc. So we just check exact matching ignoring apostrophes or special characters could be permitted, but tokens here are close enough.

",thechainsmokersandcoldplay,wizkhalifa&charlieputh,1.0,key_match,0.0,"Let's analyze each pair (response vs target) according to the grading criterion:

Criterion:  
- ""It is sufficient if the semantics are approximately the same as the reference answer or if they point to the same entity.""  
- No need for word-for-word correspondence. So basically if the response is the same song title as the target (ignoring casing, spacing, minor punctuation), score = 1; else 0.

Note: Song titles in the responses and targets are mostly lowercase, no spaces or apostrophes etc. So we just check exact matching ignoring apostrophes or special characters could be permitted, but tokens here are close enough.

",migosfeaturingliluzivert,kendricklamar,1.0,key_match,0.0,"Let's analyze each pair (response vs target) according to the grading criterion:

Criterion:  
- ""It is sufficient if the semantics are approximately the same as the reference answer or if they point to the same entity.""  
- No need for word-for-word correspondence. So basically if the response is the same song title as the target (ignoring casing, spacing, minor punctuation), score = 1; else 0.

Note: Song titles in the responses and targets are mostly lowercase, no spaces or apostrophes etc. So we just check exact matching ignoring apostrophes or special characters could be permitted, but tokens here are close enough.

",thechainsmokersfeaturinghalsey,beyoncé,1.0,key_match,0.0,"Let's analyze each pair (response vs target) according to the grading criterion:

Criterion:  
- ""It is sufficient if the semantics are approximately the same as the reference answer or if they point to the same entity.""  
- No need for word-for-word correspondence. So basically if the response is the same song title as the target (ignoring casing, spacing, minor punctuation), score = 1; else 0.

Note: Song titles in the responses and targets are mostly lowercase, no spaces or apostrophes etc. So we just check exact matching ignoring apostrophes or special characters could be permitted, but tokens here are close enough.

",samhunt,thechainsmokers,1.0,key_match,0.0,"Let's analyze each pair (response vs target) according to the grading criterion:

Criterion:  
- ""It is sufficient if the semantics are approximately the same as the reference answer or if they point to the same entity.""  
- No need for word-for-word correspondence. So basically if the response is the same song title as the target (ignoring casing, spacing, minor punctuation), score = 1; else 0.

Note: Song titles in the responses and targets are mostly lowercase, no spaces or apostrophes etc. So we just check exact matching ignoring apostrophes or special characters could be permitted, but tokens here are close enough.

",imaginedragons,samsmith,1.0,key_match,0.0,"Let's analyze each pair (response vs target) according to the grading criterion:

Criterion:  
- ""It is sufficient if the semantics are approximately the same as the reference answer or if they point to the same entity.""  
- No need for word-for-word correspondence. So basically if the response is the same song title as the target (ignoring casing, spacing, minor punctuation), score = 1; else 0.

Note: Song titles in the responses and targets are mostly lowercase, no spaces or apostrophes etc. So we just check exact matching ignoring apostrophes or special characters could be permitted, but tokens here are close enough.

",postmalonefeaturingquavo,brunomars,1.0,key_match,0.0,"Let's analyze each pair (response vs target) according to the grading criterion:

Criterion:  
- ""It is sufficient if the semantics are approximately the same as the reference answer or if they point to the same entity.""  
- No need for word-for-word correspondence. So basically if the response is the same song title as the target (ignoring casing, spacing, minor punctuation), score = 1; else 0.

Note: Song titles in the responses and targets are mostly lowercase, no spaces or apostrophes etc. So we just check exact matching ignoring apostrophes or special characters could be permitted, but tokens here are close enough.

",drake,edsheeran,1.0,key_match,0.0,"Let's analyze each pair (response vs target) according to the grading criterion:

Criterion:  
- ""It is sufficient if the semantics are approximately the same as the reference answer or if they point to the same entity.""  
- No need for word-for-word correspondence. So basically if the response is the same song title as the target (ignoring casing, spacing, minor punctuation), score = 1; else 0.

Note: Song titles in the responses and targets are mostly lowercase, no spaces or apostrophes etc. So we just check exact matching ignoring apostrophes or special characters could be permitted, but tokens here are close enough.

",edsheeran,luisfonsi&daddyyankee,1.0,key_match,0.0,"Let's analyze each pair (response vs target) according to the grading criterion:

Criterion:  
- ""It is sufficient if the semantics are approximately the same as the reference answer or if they point to the same entity.""  
- No need for word-for-word correspondence. So basically if the response is the same song title as the target (ignoring casing, spacing, minor punctuation), score = 1; else 0.

Note: Song titles in the responses and targets are mostly lowercase, no spaces or apostrophes etc. So we just check exact matching ignoring apostrophes or special characters could be permitted, but tokens here are close enough.

",beberexhafeaturingfloridageorgialine,billieeilish,1.0,key_match,0.0,"Let's analyze each pair (response vs target) according to the grading criterion:

Criterion:  
- ""It is sufficient if the semantics are approximately the same as the reference answer or if they point to the same entity.""  
- No need for word-for-word correspondence. So basically if the response is the same song title as the target (ignoring casing, spacing, minor punctuation), score = 1; else 0.

Note: Song titles in the responses and targets are mostly lowercase, no spaces or apostrophes etc. So we just check exact matching ignoring apostrophes or special characters could be permitted, but tokens here are close enough.

",camilacabellofeaturingyoungthug,demilovato,1.0,key_match,0.0,"Let's analyze each pair (response vs target) according to the grading criterion:

Criterion:  
- ""It is sufficient if the semantics are approximately the same as the reference answer or if they point to the same entity.""  
- No need for word-for-word correspondence. So basically if the response is the same song title as the target (ignoring casing, spacing, minor punctuation), score = 1; else 0.

Note: Song titles in the responses and targets are mostly lowercase, no spaces or apostrophes etc. So we just check exact matching ignoring apostrophes or special characters could be permitted, but tokens here are close enough.

",postmalonefeaturing21savage,justinbieber,1.0,key_match,0.0,"Let's analyze each pair (response vs target) according to the grading criterion:

Criterion:  
- ""It is sufficient if the semantics are approximately the same as the reference answer or if they point to the same entity.""  
- No need for word-for-word correspondence. So basically if the response is the same song title as the target (ignoring casing, spacing, minor punctuation), score = 1; else 0.

Note: Song titles in the responses and targets are mostly lowercase, no spaces or apostrophes etc. So we just check exact matching ignoring apostrophes or special characters could be permitted, but tokens here are close enough.

",postmalonefeaturingtydollasign,kendricklamar,1.0,key_match,0.0,"Let's analyze each pair (response vs target) according to the grading criterion:

Criterion:  
- ""It is sufficient if the semantics are approximately the same as the reference answer or if they point to the same entity.""  
- No need for word-for-word correspondence. So basically if the response is the same song title as the target (ignoring casing, spacing, minor punctuation), score = 1; else 0.

Note: Song titles in the responses and targets are mostly lowercase, no spaces or apostrophes etc. So we just check exact matching ignoring apostrophes or special characters could be permitted, but tokens here are close enough.

","cardib,badbunnyandjbalvin",cardib,1.0,key_match,1.0,"Let's analyze each pair (response vs target) according to the grading criterion:

Criterion:  
- ""It is sufficient if the semantics are approximately the same as the reference answer or if they point to the same entity.""  
- No need for word-for-word correspondence. So basically if the response is the same song title as the target (ignoring casing, spacing, minor punctuation), score = 1; else 0.

Note: Song titles in the responses and targets are mostly lowercase, no spaces or apostrophes etc. So we just check exact matching ignoring apostrophes or special characters could be permitted, but tokens here are close enough.

","zedd,marenmorrisandgrey",zedd,1.0,key_match,0.0,"Let's analyze each pair (response vs target) according to the grading criterion:

Criterion:  
- ""It is sufficient if the semantics are approximately the same as the reference answer or if they point to the same entity.""  
- No need for word-for-word correspondence. So basically if the response is the same song title as the target (ignoring casing, spacing, minor punctuation), score = 1; else 0.

Note: Song titles in the responses and targets are mostly lowercase, no spaces or apostrophes etc. So we just check exact matching ignoring apostrophes or special characters could be permitted, but tokens here are close enough.

",drake,wizkhalifa&charlieputh,1.0,key_match,0.0,"Let's analyze each pair (response vs target) according to the grading criterion:

Criterion:  
- ""It is sufficient if the semantics are approximately the same as the reference answer or if they point to the same entity.""  
- No need for word-for-word correspondence. So basically if the response is the same song title as the target (ignoring casing, spacing, minor punctuation), score = 1; else 0.

Note: Song titles in the responses and targets are mostly lowercase, no spaces or apostrophes etc. So we just check exact matching ignoring apostrophes or special characters could be permitted, but tokens here are close enough.

",maroon5featuringcardib,kendricklamar&sza,1.0,key_match,0.0,"Let's analyze each pair (response vs target) according to the grading criterion:

Criterion:  
- ""It is sufficient if the semantics are approximately the same as the reference answer or if they point to the same entity.""  
- No need for word-for-word correspondence. So basically if the response is the same song title as the target (ignoring casing, spacing, minor punctuation), score = 1; else 0.

Note: Song titles in the responses and targets are mostly lowercase, no spaces or apostrophes etc. So we just check exact matching ignoring apostrophes or special characters could be permitted, but tokens here are close enough.

",lilnasxfeaturingbillyraycyrus,lilnasx&billyraycyrus,1.0,key_match,1.0,"Let's analyze each pair (response vs target) according to the grading criterion:

Criterion:  
- ""It is sufficient if the semantics are approximately the same as the reference answer or if they point to the same entity.""  
- No need for word-for-word correspondence. So basically if the response is the same song title as the target (ignoring casing, spacing, minor punctuation), score = 1; else 0.

Note: Song titles in the responses and targets are mostly lowercase, no spaces or apostrophes etc. So we just check exact matching ignoring apostrophes or special characters could be permitted, but tokens here are close enough.

",postmaloneandswaelee,theweeknd,1.0,key_match,0.0,"Let's analyze each pair (response vs target) according to the grading criterion:

Criterion:  
- ""It is sufficient if the semantics are approximately the same as the reference answer or if they point to the same entity.""  
- No need for word-for-word correspondence. So basically if the response is the same song title as the target (ignoring casing, spacing, minor punctuation), score = 1; else 0.

Note: Song titles in the responses and targets are mostly lowercase, no spaces or apostrophes etc. So we just check exact matching ignoring apostrophes or special characters could be permitted, but tokens here are close enough.

",halsey,billieeilish,1.0,key_match,0.0,"Let's analyze each pair (response vs target) according to the grading criterion:

Criterion:  
- ""It is sufficient if the semantics are approximately the same as the reference answer or if they point to the same entity.""  
- No need for word-for-word correspondence. So basically if the response is the same song title as the target (ignoring casing, spacing, minor punctuation), score = 1; else 0.

Note: Song titles in the responses and targets are mostly lowercase, no spaces or apostrophes etc. So we just check exact matching ignoring apostrophes or special characters could be permitted, but tokens here are close enough.

",billieeilish,shawnmendes&camilacabello,1.0,key_match,0.0,"Let's analyze each pair (response vs target) according to the grading criterion:

Criterion:  
- ""It is sufficient if the semantics are approximately the same as the reference answer or if they point to the same entity.""  
- No need for word-for-word correspondence. So basically if the response is the same song title as the target (ignoring casing, spacing, minor punctuation), score = 1; else 0.

Note: Song titles in the responses and targets are mostly lowercase, no spaces or apostrophes etc. So we just check exact matching ignoring apostrophes or special characters could be permitted, but tokens here are close enough.

",postmalone,dualipa,1.0,key_match,0.0,"Let's analyze each pair (response vs target) according to the grading criterion:

Criterion:  
- ""It is sufficient if the semantics are approximately the same as the reference answer or if they point to the same entity.""  
- No need for word-for-word correspondence. So basically if the response is the same song title as the target (ignoring casing, spacing, minor punctuation), score = 1; else 0.

Note: Song titles in the responses and targets are mostly lowercase, no spaces or apostrophes etc. So we just check exact matching ignoring apostrophes or special characters could be permitted, but tokens here are close enough.

",marshmelloandbastille,lewiscapaldi,1.0,key_match,0.0,"Let's analyze each pair (response vs target) according to the grading criterion:

Criterion:  
- ""It is sufficient if the semantics are approximately the same as the reference answer or if they point to the same entity.""  
- No need for word-for-word correspondence. So basically if the response is the same song title as the target (ignoring casing, spacing, minor punctuation), score = 1; else 0.

Note: Song titles in the responses and targets are mostly lowercase, no spaces or apostrophes etc. So we just check exact matching ignoring apostrophes or special characters could be permitted, but tokens here are close enough.

",arianagrande,justinbieber,1.0,key_match,0.0,"Let's analyze each pair (response vs target) according to the grading criterion:

Criterion:  
- ""It is sufficient if the semantics are approximately the same as the reference answer or if they point to the same entity.""  
- No need for word-for-word correspondence. So basically if the response is the same song title as the target (ignoring casing, spacing, minor punctuation), score = 1; else 0.

Note: Song titles in the responses and targets are mostly lowercase, no spaces or apostrophes etc. So we just check exact matching ignoring apostrophes or special characters could be permitted, but tokens here are close enough.

",khalid,theweeknd,1.0,key_match,0.0,"Let's analyze each pair (response vs target) according to the grading criterion:

Criterion:  
- ""It is sufficient if the semantics are approximately the same as the reference answer or if they point to the same entity.""  
- No need for word-for-word correspondence. So basically if the response is the same song title as the target (ignoring casing, spacing, minor punctuation), score = 1; else 0.

Note: Song titles in the responses and targets are mostly lowercase, no spaces or apostrophes etc. So we just check exact matching ignoring apostrophes or special characters could be permitted, but tokens here are close enough.

",travisscott,selenagomez,1.0,key_match,0.0,"Let's analyze each pair (response vs target) according to the grading criterion:

Criterion:  
- ""It is sufficient if the semantics are approximately the same as the reference answer or if they point to the same entity.""  
- No need for word-for-word correspondence. So basically if the response is the same song title as the target (ignoring casing, spacing, minor punctuation), score = 1; else 0.

Note: Song titles in the responses and targets are mostly lowercase, no spaces or apostrophes etc. So we just check exact matching ignoring apostrophes or special characters could be permitted, but tokens here are close enough.

",jonasbrothers,marshmello&bastille,1.0,key_match,0.0,"Let's analyze each pair (response vs target) according to the grading criterion:

Criterion:  
- ""It is sufficient if the semantics are approximately the same as the reference answer or if they point to the same entity.""  
- No need for word-for-word correspondence. So basically if the response is the same song title as the target (ignoring casing, spacing, minor punctuation), score = 1; else 0.

Note: Song titles in the responses and targets are mostly lowercase, no spaces or apostrophes etc. So we just check exact matching ignoring apostrophes or special characters could be permitted, but tokens here are close enough.

",theweeknd,theweeknd,1.0,key_match,1.0,"Let's analyze each pair (response vs target) according to the grading criterion:

Criterion:  
- ""It is sufficient if the semantics are approximately the same as the reference answer or if they point to the same entity.""  
- No need for word-for-word correspondence. So basically if the response is the same song title as the target (ignoring casing, spacing, minor punctuation), score = 1; else 0.

Note: Song titles in the responses and targets are mostly lowercase, no spaces or apostrophes etc. So we just check exact matching ignoring apostrophes or special characters could be permitted, but tokens here are close enough.

",postmalone,dualipa&dababy,1.0,key_match,0.0,"Let's analyze each pair (response vs target) according to the grading criterion:

Criterion:  
- ""It is sufficient if the semantics are approximately the same as the reference answer or if they point to the same entity.""  
- No need for word-for-word correspondence. So basically if the response is the same song title as the target (ignoring casing, spacing, minor punctuation), score = 1; else 0.

Note: Song titles in the responses and targets are mostly lowercase, no spaces or apostrophes etc. So we just check exact matching ignoring apostrophes or special characters could be permitted, but tokens here are close enough.

",roddyricch,dualipa,1.0,key_match,0.0,"Let's analyze each pair (response vs target) according to the grading criterion:

Criterion:  
- ""It is sufficient if the semantics are approximately the same as the reference answer or if they point to the same entity.""  
- No need for word-for-word correspondence. So basically if the response is the same song title as the target (ignoring casing, spacing, minor punctuation), score = 1; else 0.

Note: Song titles in the responses and targets are mostly lowercase, no spaces or apostrophes etc. So we just check exact matching ignoring apostrophes or special characters could be permitted, but tokens here are close enough.

",dualipa,edsheeran,1.0,key_match,0.0,"Let's analyze each pair (response vs target) according to the grading criterion:

Criterion:  
- ""It is sufficient if the semantics are approximately the same as the reference answer or if they point to the same entity.""  
- No need for word-for-word correspondence. So basically if the response is the same song title as the target (ignoring casing, spacing, minor punctuation), score = 1; else 0.

Note: Song titles in the responses and targets are mostly lowercase, no spaces or apostrophes etc. So we just check exact matching ignoring apostrophes or special characters could be permitted, but tokens here are close enough.

",dababyfeaturingroddyricch,samsmith,1.0,key_match,0.0,"Let's analyze each pair (response vs target) according to the grading criterion:

Criterion:  
- ""It is sufficient if the semantics are approximately the same as the reference answer or if they point to the same entity.""  
- No need for word-for-word correspondence. So basically if the response is the same song title as the target (ignoring casing, spacing, minor punctuation), score = 1; else 0.

Note: Song titles in the responses and targets are mostly lowercase, no spaces or apostrophes etc. So we just check exact matching ignoring apostrophes or special characters could be permitted, but tokens here are close enough.

",harrystyles,dojacat,1.0,key_match,0.0,"Let's analyze each pair (response vs target) according to the grading criterion:

Criterion:  
- ""It is sufficient if the semantics are approximately the same as the reference answer or if they point to the same entity.""  
- No need for word-for-word correspondence. So basically if the response is the same song title as the target (ignoring casing, spacing, minor punctuation), score = 1; else 0.

Note: Song titles in the responses and targets are mostly lowercase, no spaces or apostrophes etc. So we just check exact matching ignoring apostrophes or special characters could be permitted, but tokens here are close enough.

Pairwise evaluation:

- idx_0: response='blindinglights', target='uptownfunk' -> different songs, score=0

",futurefeaturingdrake,samsmith,1.0,key_match,0.0,"Let's analyze each pair (response vs target) according to the grading criterion:

Criterion:  
- ""It is sufficient if the semantics are approximately the same as the reference answer or if they point to the same entity.""  
- No need for word-for-word correspondence. So basically if the response is the same song title as the target (ignoring casing, spacing, minor punctuation), score = 1; else 0.

Note: Song titles in the responses and targets are mostly lowercase, no spaces or apostrophes etc. So we just check exact matching ignoring apostrophes or special characters could be permitted, but tokens here are close enough.

",maroon5,justinbieber,1.0,key_match,0.0,"Let's analyze each pair (response vs target) according to the grading criterion:

Criterion:  
- ""It is sufficient if the semantics are approximately the same as the reference answer or if they point to the same entity.""  
- No need for word-for-word correspondence. So basically if the response is the same song title as the target (ignoring casing, spacing, minor punctuation), score = 1; else 0.

Note: Song titles in the responses and targets are mostly lowercase, no spaces or apostrophes etc. So we just check exact matching ignoring apostrophes or special characters could be permitted, but tokens here are close enough.

,,9,9,2020,2020,0.0,"Let's analyze each idx according to the criteria:

Criterion summary: 
- Semantics approximately the same or pointing to the same entity qualifies for score 1.
- Only exact matching or equivalent entities count as correct.
- If response and target are different entities/artists, score 0.

",marenmorris,marshmello&bastille,1.0,key_match,0.0,"Let's analyze each pair (response vs target) according to the grading criterion:

Criterion:  
- ""It is sufficient if the semantics are approximately the same as the reference answer or if they point to the same entity.""  
- No need for word-for-word correspondence. So basically if the response is the same song title as the target (ignoring casing, spacing, minor punctuation), score = 1; else 0.

Note: Song titles in the responses and targets are mostly lowercase, no spaces or apostrophes etc. So we just check exact matching ignoring apostrophes or special characters could be permitted, but tokens here are close enough.

",lewiscapaldi,selenagomez,1.0,key_match,0.0,"Let's analyze each pair (response vs target) according to the grading criterion:

Criterion:  
- ""It is sufficient if the semantics are approximately the same as the reference answer or if they point to the same entity.""  
- No need for word-for-word correspondence. So basically if the response is the same song title as the target (ignoring casing, spacing, minor punctuation), score = 1; else 0.

Note: Song titles in the responses and targets are mostly lowercase, no spaces or apostrophes etc. So we just check exact matching ignoring apostrophes or special characters could be permitted, but tokens here are close enough.

",dualipa,oliviarodrigo,1.0,key_match,0.0,"Let's analyze each pair (response vs target) according to the grading criterion:

Criterion:  
- ""It is sufficient if the semantics are approximately the same as the reference answer or if they point to the same entity.""  
- No need for word-for-word correspondence. So basically if the response is the same song title as the target (ignoring casing, spacing, minor punctuation), score = 1; else 0.

Note: Song titles in the responses and targets are mostly lowercase, no spaces or apostrophes etc. So we just check exact matching ignoring apostrophes or special characters could be permitted, but tokens here are close enough.

",theweekndandarianagrande,edsheeran,1.0,key_match,0.0,"Let's analyze each pair (response vs target) according to the grading criterion:

Criterion:  
- ""It is sufficient if the semantics are approximately the same as the reference answer or if they point to the same entity.""  
- No need for word-for-word correspondence. So basically if the response is the same song title as the target (ignoring casing, spacing, minor punctuation), score = 1; else 0.

Note: Song titles in the responses and targets are mostly lowercase, no spaces or apostrophes etc. So we just check exact matching ignoring apostrophes or special characters could be permitted, but tokens here are close enough.

",theweeknd,dojacat&sza,1.0,key_match,0.0,"Let's analyze each pair (response vs target) according to the grading criterion:

Criterion:  
- ""It is sufficient if the semantics are approximately the same as the reference answer or if they point to the same entity.""  
- No need for word-for-word correspondence. So basically if the response is the same song title as the target (ignoring casing, spacing, minor punctuation), score = 1; else 0.

Note: Song titles in the responses and targets are mostly lowercase, no spaces or apostrophes etc. So we just check exact matching ignoring apostrophes or special characters could be permitted, but tokens here are close enough.

",24kgoldnfeaturingianndior,selenagomez,1.0,key_match,0.0,"Let's analyze each pair (response vs target) according to the grading criterion:

Criterion:  
- ""It is sufficient if the semantics are approximately the same as the reference answer or if they point to the same entity.""  
- No need for word-for-word correspondence. So basically if the response is the same song title as the target (ignoring casing, spacing, minor punctuation), score = 1; else 0.

Note: Song titles in the responses and targets are mostly lowercase, no spaces or apostrophes etc. So we just check exact matching ignoring apostrophes or special characters could be permitted, but tokens here are close enough.

",oliviarodrigo,thekidlaroi&justinbieber,1.0,key_match,0.0,"Let's analyze each pair (response vs target) according to the grading criterion:

Criterion:  
- ""It is sufficient if the semantics are approximately the same as the reference answer or if they point to the same entity.""  
- No need for word-for-word correspondence. So basically if the response is the same song title as the target (ignoring casing, spacing, minor punctuation), score = 1; else 0.

Note: Song titles in the responses and targets are mostly lowercase, no spaces or apostrophes etc. So we just check exact matching ignoring apostrophes or special characters could be permitted, but tokens here are close enough.

",dojacatfeaturingsza,theweeknd&arianagrande,1.0,key_match,0.0,"Let's analyze each pair (response vs target) according to the grading criterion:

Criterion:  
- ""It is sufficient if the semantics are approximately the same as the reference answer or if they point to the same entity.""  
- No need for word-for-word correspondence. So basically if the response is the same song title as the target (ignoring casing, spacing, minor punctuation), score = 1; else 0.

Note: Song titles in the responses and targets are mostly lowercase, no spaces or apostrophes etc. So we just check exact matching ignoring apostrophes or special characters could be permitted, but tokens here are close enough.

",silksonic(brunomarsandanderson.paak),megantheestallion,1.0,key_match,0.0,"Let's analyze each pair (response vs target) according to the grading criterion:

Criterion:  
- ""It is sufficient if the semantics are approximately the same as the reference answer or if they point to the same entity.""  
- No need for word-for-word correspondence. So basically if the response is the same song title as the target (ignoring casing, spacing, minor punctuation), score = 1; else 0.

Note: Song titles in the responses and targets are mostly lowercase, no spaces or apostrophes etc. So we just check exact matching ignoring apostrophes or special characters could be permitted, but tokens here are close enough.

",oliviarodrigo,dojacat,1.0,key_match,0.0,"Let's analyze each pair (response vs target) according to the grading criterion:

Criterion:  
- ""It is sufficient if the semantics are approximately the same as the reference answer or if they point to the same entity.""  
- No need for word-for-word correspondence. So basically if the response is the same song title as the target (ignoring casing, spacing, minor punctuation), score = 1; else 0.

Note: Song titles in the responses and targets are mostly lowercase, no spaces or apostrophes etc. So we just check exact matching ignoring apostrophes or special characters could be permitted, but tokens here are close enough.

",lilnasx,samsmith,1.0,key_match,0.0,"Let's analyze each pair (response vs target) according to the grading criterion:

Criterion:  
- ""It is sufficient if the semantics are approximately the same as the reference answer or if they point to the same entity.""  
- No need for word-for-word correspondence. So basically if the response is the same song title as the target (ignoring casing, spacing, minor punctuation), score = 1; else 0.

Note: Song titles in the responses and targets are mostly lowercase, no spaces or apostrophes etc. So we just check exact matching ignoring apostrophes or special characters could be permitted, but tokens here are close enough.

",justinbieberfeaturingdanielcaesarandgiveon,marshmello&bastille,1.0,key_match,0.0,"Let's analyze each pair (response vs target) according to the grading criterion:

Criterion:  
- ""It is sufficient if the semantics are approximately the same as the reference answer or if they point to the same entity.""  
- No need for word-for-word correspondence. So basically if the response is the same song title as the target (ignoring casing, spacing, minor punctuation), score = 1; else 0.

Note: Song titles in the responses and targets are mostly lowercase, no spaces or apostrophes etc. So we just check exact matching ignoring apostrophes or special characters could be permitted, but tokens here are close enough.

",glassanimals,oliviarodrigo,1.0,key_match,0.0,"Let's analyze each pair (response vs target) according to the grading criterion:

Criterion:  
- ""It is sufficient if the semantics are approximately the same as the reference answer or if they point to the same entity.""  
- No need for word-for-word correspondence. So basically if the response is the same song title as the target (ignoring casing, spacing, minor punctuation), score = 1; else 0.

Note: Song titles in the responses and targets are mostly lowercase, no spaces or apostrophes etc. So we just check exact matching ignoring apostrophes or special characters could be permitted, but tokens here are close enough.

",harrystyles,edsheeran,1.0,key_match,0.0,"Let's analyze each pair (response vs target) according to the grading criterion:

Criterion:  
- ""It is sufficient if the semantics are approximately the same as the reference answer or if they point to the same entity.""  
- No need for word-for-word correspondence. So basically if the response is the same song title as the target (ignoring casing, spacing, minor punctuation), score = 1; else 0.

Note: Song titles in the responses and targets are mostly lowercase, no spaces or apostrophes etc. So we just check exact matching ignoring apostrophes or special characters could be permitted, but tokens here are close enough.

",thekidlaroiandjustinbieber,megantheestallion,1.0,key_match,0.0,"Let's analyze each pair (response vs target) according to the grading criterion:

Criterion:  
- ""It is sufficient if the semantics are approximately the same as the reference answer or if they point to the same entity.""  
- No need for word-for-word correspondence. So basically if the response is the same song title as the target (ignoring casing, spacing, minor punctuation), score = 1; else 0.

Note: Song titles in the responses and targets are mostly lowercase, no spaces or apostrophes etc. So we just check exact matching ignoring apostrophes or special characters could be permitted, but tokens here are close enough.

",adele,dualipa,1.0,key_match,0.0,"Let's analyze each pair (response vs target) according to the grading criterion:

Criterion:  
- ""It is sufficient if the semantics are approximately the same as the reference answer or if they point to the same entity.""  
- No need for word-for-word correspondence. So basically if the response is the same song title as the target (ignoring casing, spacing, minor punctuation), score = 1; else 0.

Note: Song titles in the responses and targets are mostly lowercase, no spaces or apostrophes etc. So we just check exact matching ignoring apostrophes or special characters could be permitted, but tokens here are close enough.

",edsheeran,selenagomez,1.0,key_match,0.0,"Let's analyze each pair (response vs target) according to the grading criterion:

Criterion:  
- ""It is sufficient if the semantics are approximately the same as the reference answer or if they point to the same entity.""  
- No need for word-for-word correspondence. So basically if the response is the same song title as the target (ignoring casing, spacing, minor punctuation), score = 1; else 0.

Note: Song titles in the responses and targets are mostly lowercase, no spaces or apostrophes etc. So we just check exact matching ignoring apostrophes or special characters could be permitted, but tokens here are close enough.

",jackharlow,dojacat,1.0,key_match,0.0,"Let's analyze each pair (response vs target) according to the grading criterion:

Criterion:  
- ""It is sufficient if the semantics are approximately the same as the reference answer or if they point to the same entity.""  
- No need for word-for-word correspondence. So basically if the response is the same song title as the target (ignoring casing, spacing, minor punctuation), score = 1; else 0.

Note: Song titles in the responses and targets are mostly lowercase, no spaces or apostrophes etc. So we just check exact matching ignoring apostrophes or special characters could be permitted, but tokens here are close enough.

",latto,samsmith,1.0,key_match,0.0,"Let's analyze each pair (response vs target) according to the grading criterion:

Criterion:  
- ""It is sufficient if the semantics are approximately the same as the reference answer or if they point to the same entity.""  
- No need for word-for-word correspondence. So basically if the response is the same song title as the target (ignoring casing, spacing, minor punctuation), score = 1; else 0.

Note: Song titles in the responses and targets are mostly lowercase, no spaces or apostrophes etc. So we just check exact matching ignoring apostrophes or special characters could be permitted, but tokens here are close enough.

",justinbieber,theweeknd&arianagrande,1.0,key_match,0.0,"Let's analyze each pair (response vs target) according to the grading criterion:

Criterion:  
- ""It is sufficient if the semantics are approximately the same as the reference answer or if they point to the same entity.""  
- No need for word-for-word correspondence. So basically if the response is the same song title as the target (ignoring casing, spacing, minor punctuation), score = 1; else 0.

Note: Song titles in the responses and targets are mostly lowercase, no spaces or apostrophes etc. So we just check exact matching ignoring apostrophes or special characters could be permitted, but tokens here are close enough.

",kodakblack,thekidlaroi&justinbieber,1.0,key_match,0.0,"Let's analyze each pair (response vs target) according to the grading criterion:

Criterion:  
- ""It is sufficient if the semantics are approximately the same as the reference answer or if they point to the same entity.""  
- No need for word-for-word correspondence. So basically if the response is the same song title as the target (ignoring casing, spacing, minor punctuation), score = 1; else 0.

Note: Song titles in the responses and targets are mostly lowercase, no spaces or apostrophes etc. So we just check exact matching ignoring apostrophes or special characters could be permitted, but tokens here are close enough.

",eltonjohnanddualipa,marshmello&bastille,1.0,key_match,0.0,"Let's analyze each pair (response vs target) according to the grading criterion:

Criterion:  
- ""It is sufficient if the semantics are approximately the same as the reference answer or if they point to the same entity.""  
- No need for word-for-word correspondence. So basically if the response is the same song title as the target (ignoring casing, spacing, minor punctuation), score = 1; else 0.

Note: Song titles in the responses and targets are mostly lowercase, no spaces or apostrophes etc. So we just check exact matching ignoring apostrophes or special characters could be permitted, but tokens here are close enough.

",morganwallen,oliviarodrigo,1.0,key_match,0.0,"Let's analyze each pair (response vs target) according to the grading criterion:

Criterion:  
- ""It is sufficient if the semantics are approximately the same as the reference answer or if they point to the same entity.""  
- No need for word-for-word correspondence. So basically if the response is the same song title as the target (ignoring casing, spacing, minor punctuation), score = 1; else 0.

Note: Song titles in the responses and targets are mostly lowercase, no spaces or apostrophes etc. So we just check exact matching ignoring apostrophes or special characters could be permitted, but tokens here are close enough.

",mileycyrus,edsheeran,1.0,key_match,0.0,"Let's analyze each pair (response vs target) according to the grading criterion:

Criterion:  
- ""It is sufficient if the semantics are approximately the same as the reference answer or if they point to the same entity.""  
- No need for word-for-word correspondence. So basically if the response is the same song title as the target (ignoring casing, spacing, minor punctuation), score = 1; else 0.

Note: Song titles in the responses and targets are mostly lowercase, no spaces or apostrophes etc. So we just check exact matching ignoring apostrophes or special characters could be permitted, but tokens here are close enough.

",sza,megantheestallion,1.0,key_match,0.0,"Let's analyze each pair (response vs target) according to the grading criterion:

Criterion:  
- ""It is sufficient if the semantics are approximately the same as the reference answer or if they point to the same entity.""  
- No need for word-for-word correspondence. So basically if the response is the same song title as the target (ignoring casing, spacing, minor punctuation), score = 1; else 0.

Note: Song titles in the responses and targets are mostly lowercase, no spaces or apostrophes etc. So we just check exact matching ignoring apostrophes or special characters could be permitted, but tokens here are close enough.

",taylorswift,dualipa,1.0,key_match,0.0,"Let's analyze each pair (response vs target) according to the grading criterion:

Criterion:  
- ""It is sufficient if the semantics are approximately the same as the reference answer or if they point to the same entity.""  
- No need for word-for-word correspondence. So basically if the response is the same song title as the target (ignoring casing, spacing, minor punctuation), score = 1; else 0.

Note: Song titles in the responses and targets are mostly lowercase, no spaces or apostrophes etc. So we just check exact matching ignoring apostrophes or special characters could be permitted, but tokens here are close enough.

","metroboomin,theweekndand21savage",selenagomez,1.0,key_match,0.0,"Let's analyze each pair (response vs target) according to the grading criterion:

Criterion:  
- ""It is sufficient if the semantics are approximately the same as the reference answer or if they point to the same entity.""  
- No need for word-for-word correspondence. So basically if the response is the same song title as the target (ignoring casing, spacing, minor punctuation), score = 1; else 0.

Note: Song titles in the responses and targets are mostly lowercase, no spaces or apostrophes etc. So we just check exact matching ignoring apostrophes or special characters could be permitted, but tokens here are close enough.

",remaandselenagomez,dojacat,1.0,key_match,0.0,"Let's analyze each pair (response vs target) according to the grading criterion:

Criterion:  
- ""It is sufficient if the semantics are approximately the same as the reference answer or if they point to the same entity.""  
- No need for word-for-word correspondence. So basically if the response is the same song title as the target (ignoring casing, spacing, minor punctuation), score = 1; else 0.

Note: Song titles in the responses and targets are mostly lowercase, no spaces or apostrophes etc. So we just check exact matching ignoring apostrophes or special characters could be permitted, but tokens here are close enough.

",theweekndandarianagrande,samsmith,1.0,key_match,0.0,"Let's analyze each pair (response vs target) according to the grading criterion:

Criterion:  
- ""It is sufficient if the semantics are approximately the same as the reference answer or if they point to the same entity.""  
- No need for word-for-word correspondence. So basically if the response is the same song title as the target (ignoring casing, spacing, minor punctuation), score = 1; else 0.

Note: Song titles in the responses and targets are mostly lowercase, no spaces or apostrophes etc. So we just check exact matching ignoring apostrophes or special characters could be permitted, but tokens here are close enough.

",lukecombs,theweeknd&arianagrande,1.0,key_match,0.0,"Let's analyze each pair (response vs target) according to the grading criterion:

Criterion:  
- ""It is sufficient if the semantics are approximately the same as the reference answer or if they point to the same entity.""  
- No need for word-for-word correspondence. So basically if the response is the same song title as the target (ignoring casing, spacing, minor punctuation), score = 1; else 0.

Note: Song titles in the responses and targets are mostly lowercase, no spaces or apostrophes etc. So we just check exact matching ignoring apostrophes or special characters could be permitted, but tokens here are close enough.

",sza,thekidlaroi&justinbieber,1.0,key_match,0.0,"Let's analyze each pair (response vs target) according to the grading criterion:

Criterion:  
- ""It is sufficient if the semantics are approximately the same as the reference answer or if they point to the same entity.""  
- No need for word-for-word correspondence. So basically if the response is the same song title as the target (ignoring casing, spacing, minor punctuation), score = 1; else 0.

Note: Song titles in the responses and targets are mostly lowercase, no spaces or apostrophes etc. So we just check exact matching ignoring apostrophes or special characters could be permitted, but tokens here are close enough.

",davidguettaandbeberexha,marshmello&bastille,1.0,key_match,0.0,"Let's analyze each pair (response vs target) according to the grading criterion:

Criterion:  
- ""It is sufficient if the semantics are approximately the same as the reference answer or if they point to the same entity.""  
- No need for word-for-word correspondence. So basically if the response is the same song title as the target (ignoring casing, spacing, minor punctuation), score = 1; else 0.

Note: Song titles in the responses and targets are mostly lowercase, no spaces or apostrophes etc. So we just check exact matching ignoring apostrophes or special characters could be permitted, but tokens here are close enough.

",teddyswims,bensonboone,1.0,key_match,0.0,"Let's analyze each pair (response vs target) according to the grading criterion:

Criterion:  
- ""It is sufficient if the semantics are approximately the same as the reference answer or if they point to the same entity.""  
- No need for word-for-word correspondence. So basically if the response is the same song title as the target (ignoring casing, spacing, minor punctuation), score = 1; else 0.

Note: Song titles in the responses and targets are mostly lowercase, no spaces or apostrophes etc. So we just check exact matching ignoring apostrophes or special characters could be permitted, but tokens here are close enough.

",shaboozey,postmalone&morganwallen,1.0,key_match,0.0,"Let's analyze each pair (response vs target) according to the grading criterion:

Criterion:  
- ""It is sufficient if the semantics are approximately the same as the reference answer or if they point to the same entity.""  
- No need for word-for-word correspondence. So basically if the response is the same song title as the target (ignoring casing, spacing, minor punctuation), score = 1; else 0.

Note: Song titles in the responses and targets are mostly lowercase, no spaces or apostrophes etc. So we just check exact matching ignoring apostrophes or special characters could be permitted, but tokens here are close enough.

",bensonboone,jackharlow,1.0,key_match,0.0,"Let's analyze each pair (response vs target) according to the grading criterion:

Criterion:  
- ""It is sufficient if the semantics are approximately the same as the reference answer or if they point to the same entity.""  
- No need for word-for-word correspondence. So basically if the response is the same song title as the target (ignoring casing, spacing, minor punctuation), score = 1; else 0.

Note: Song titles in the responses and targets are mostly lowercase, no spaces or apostrophes etc. So we just check exact matching ignoring apostrophes or special characters could be permitted, but tokens here are close enough.

",postmalonefeaturingmorganwallen,kendricklamar,1.0,key_match,0.0,"Let's analyze each pair (response vs target) according to the grading criterion:

Criterion:  
- ""It is sufficient if the semantics are approximately the same as the reference answer or if they point to the same entity.""  
- No need for word-for-word correspondence. So basically if the response is the same song title as the target (ignoring casing, spacing, minor punctuation), score = 1; else 0.

Note: Song titles in the responses and targets are mostly lowercase, no spaces or apostrophes etc. So we just check exact matching ignoring apostrophes or special characters could be permitted, but tokens here are close enough.
