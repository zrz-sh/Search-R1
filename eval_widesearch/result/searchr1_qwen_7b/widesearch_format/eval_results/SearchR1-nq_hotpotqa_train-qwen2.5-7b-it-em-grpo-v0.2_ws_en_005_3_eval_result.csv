Final summary: No responses match the target's semantics approximately or point to the same entity because the responses either give a number ""4.0"" (probably GPA scale or some value), which does not state any minimum or requirement, or say no minimum GPA specified when the target specifies a minimum.

Therefore, all scores are 0.

Therefore, all scores are 0.
