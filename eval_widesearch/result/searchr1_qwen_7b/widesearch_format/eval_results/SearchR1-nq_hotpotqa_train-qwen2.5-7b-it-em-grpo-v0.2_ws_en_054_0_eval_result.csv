- Standard answer (target) for idx_0: ""2024""
- Response for idx_0: ""2010""

Criterion analysis:
- The semantics should be approximately the same or point to the same entity.
- A one-year gap between the answer and reference answer is allowed.
- Here, the difference is 2024 - 2010 = 14 years, which exceeds the allowed one-year gap.
- Therefore, the response ""2010"" does not sufficiently match the standard answer ""2024"".

Based on this, the score for idx_0 should be 0.

```json
{
    ""idx_0"": 0
}
```",2024,2010,1.0,"Let's analyze the given pair:

- idx_0:
  - Reference answer: ""texas""
  - Response: ""texas""
  - The response exactly matches the reference answer.
  - According to the criterion, either approximate semantics or identical entity is sufficient.
  - Here, it is an exact match, so it obviously qualifies for the full score.
