**idx_0:**  
- Response: 2008  
- Target: 2010  
Difference: 2 years earlier.  
Is 2008 roughly the same as 2010 or pointing to the same entity/time?  
No clear indication that 2008 can be considered semantically the same as 2010 in general. A 2-year difference in a year answer is distinct. Usually, year answers are exact or very close. The criterion allows roughly the same semantic meaning or same entity but not such a difference. No additional context to say 2008 means the same as 2010. Score: 0.

Similar to idx_0. Two years is a moderate gap but still relatively close. Depending on strictness, 2 years might be borderline. However, criterion uses ""roughly the same,"" which is somewhat lenient. If 1 year difference is accepted, then 2 years might also be acceptable. Without further context, it's safer to be consistent with idx_0's scoring. But since the criterion says roughly the same is acceptable, and 2 years difference might still be ""roughly"" the same, let's accept it. Score: 1.

```",jyp,jyp,1.0,"exact match, response: 2020, target: 2020",2020,2020,1.0,"Let's analyze each pair according to the criterion:

Criterion: The response and the standard answer should have roughly the same semantic meaning or refer to the same entity. Exact match is not required, but they should at least point to the same entity or be close enough.

---

**idx_0:**  
- Response: 2008  
- Target: 2010  
Difference: 2 years earlier.  
Is 2008 roughly the same as 2010 or pointing to the same entity/time?  
No clear indication that 2008 can be considered semantically the same as 2010 in general. A 2-year difference in a year answer is distinct. Usually, year answers are exact or very close. The criterion allows roughly the same semantic meaning or same entity but not such a difference. No additional context to say 2008 means the same as 2010. Score: 0.

---

**idx_1:**  
- Response: 2014  
- Target: 2009  
Difference: 5 years later.  
Difference is even larger than idx_0, so similar reasoning applies. Unless context allows for such a gap, the two years are distinct entities. Score: 0.

---

**idx_2:**  
- Response: 2017  
- Target: 2016  
Difference: 1 year later.  
This is very close and can reasonably be considered ""roughly the same."" 1 year difference is minimal and likely acceptable under ""roughly the same semantic meaning or pointing to the same entity."" Score: 1.

---

**idx_3:**  
- Response: 2018  
- Target: 2020  
Difference: 2 years earlier.  
Similar to idx_0. Two years is a moderate gap but still relatively close. Depending on strictness, 2 years might be borderline. However, criterion uses ""roughly the same,"" which is somewhat lenient. If 1 year difference is accepted, then 2 years might also be acceptable. Without further context, it's safer to be consistent with idx_0's scoring. But since the criterion says roughly the same is acceptable, and 2 years difference might still be ""roughly"" the same, let's accept it. Score: 1.

---

**idx_4:**  
- Response: 2021  
- Target: 2023  
Difference: 2 years earlier.  
Same reasoning as idx_3. Two years is likely acceptable. Score: 1.

```",2023,2021,0.0,"Let's analyze each pair step by step according to the grading criterion:

Criterion: The response is considered correct if it has the same or roughly the same semantic meaning or points to the same entity as the target. Exact word-by-word match is not necessary.

---

**idx_0:**  
- Response: ""notimetocry""  
- Target: ""can'tletyougoevenifidie""  
Analysis: ""notimetocry"" and ""can'tletyougoevenifidie"" are clearly different phrases and don't appear related semantically or refer to the same entity (likely song titles). They do not point to same entity or meaning.  
Score: 0

**idx_1:**  
- Response: ""superclap""  
- Target: ""again&again""  
Analysis: ""superclap"" and ""again&again"" are different. No obvious semantic overlap or same referent. Likely different song titles. Not matching.  
Score: 0

**idx_2:**  
- Response: ""signal""  
- Target: ""cheerup""  
Analysis: ""signal"" and ""cheerup"" seem to be different titles and have different meanings. No semantic equivalence or referring to same entity.  
Score: 0

**idx_3:**  
- Response: ""straykids""  
- Target: ""backdoor""  
Analysis: ""straykids"" is the name of the group (artist), ""backdoor"" is a song title by Stray Kids. The response doesn't match the target entity (the song title), rather it names the artist. Based on the criterion ""指向的实体一致"" (pointing to the same entity), this is not the case since the target is a song, response is the artist. Thus, this is not acceptable.  
Score: 0

**idx_4:**  
- Response: ""lovemelikethat""  
- Target: ""heartris""  
Analysis: ""lovemelikethat"" and ""heartris"" are different in words and likely different entities (songs). No semantic relation or identity.  
Score: 0

---

### Summary:

None of the responses match or point to the same entity as their targets.
