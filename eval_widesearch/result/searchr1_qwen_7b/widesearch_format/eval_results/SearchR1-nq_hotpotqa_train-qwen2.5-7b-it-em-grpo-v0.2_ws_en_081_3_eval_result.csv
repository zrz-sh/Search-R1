"warhammer40,000:spacemarines2","Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2",,,1.0,key_match,1.0,"First, let's analyze the given data:

- There is only one item with idx_0.
- The target is 'nan'.
- The response is also 'nan'.

According to the criterion, the semantics need to be approximately the same or point to the same entity to get a score of 1.

Here, both response and target are 'nan'. Although 'nan' usually means ""Not a Number"" or missing data, here since both response and target are identical, they point to the same entity/value.

Therefore, the response matches the target exactly in meaning.

Hence, the score for idx_0 is 1.

```json
{
    ""idx_0"": 1
}
```
",nan,nan,1.0,"Analysis:

- idx_0:
  - Reference answer: ""focusentertainment""
  - Response: ""focusentertainment""
  - Both are exactly the same, fully matching the reference.
  - According to the criterion, semantics must be approximately the same or pointing to the same entity, which is true here.
  - Score: 1

Final scoring result:

    ""idx_0"": 1
