,,2012/4/2,2012-04-02,0.0,"Let's analyze the given pair according to the provided criterion.

---

**Item:** idx_0  
- **Response:** ""notprovided""  
- **Target (standard answer):** ""43""  

**Analysis:**

The standard answer is ""43"", which is a specific numeric value. The response is ""notprovided"", indicating the answer was not given or explicitly stated.

According to the grading criterion:  
- ""It is sufficient if the semantics are approximately the same as the reference answer or if they point to the same entity.""  
- The response ""notprovided"" does not match or refer to the number ""43"" or anything equivalent semantically or referentially.  
- Therefore, the response is incorrect.

**Score:** 0

- Standard answer (target): ""koreanmale(formernursingstudent)""
- Response: ""male""

According to the grading criteria:
- It is sufficient if the semantics are approximately the same as the reference or point to the same entity.
- ""koreanmale(formernursingstudent)"" can be understood as a detailed identification referring specifically to a male Korean who was a former nursing student.
- The response only says ""male"", which is only a subset of the information in the standard answer.
- However, as per the criterion, the semantics should be approximately the same or point to the same entity. Here, ""male"" captures only the gender, while the target specifies ethnicity and prior student status as well.
- Since ""male"" is much less informative and does not fully match the entity described (not approximate, but partial), it cannot be considered sufficient.
- The criterion says approximate semantics are acceptable, but ""male"" is too generic when the target is very specific.
- Therefore, score should be 0.

Final scoring:

",koreanmale(formernursingstudent),male,1.0,key_match,1.0,"Let's analyze the given pair according to the criterion:

- Response: ""oikosuniversity""
- Target: ""oikosuniversity""

The response exactly matches the target answer. According to the criterion, it is sufficient if the semantics are approximately the same or if they point to the same entity. Here, there is an exact match, so it meets the criterion fully.

Score: 1

```",oikosuniversity,oikosuniversity,0.0,"Let's analyze the given pair according to the criterion:

- Reference answer (target): ""surrendered""
- Response: ""killed""

Criterion states: It is sufficient if the semantics are approximately the same as the reference answer or if they point to the same entity.

Here, ""killed"" and ""surrendered"" are clearly different in meaning. One implies death by violence, the other implies giving up or yielding. They do not point to the same entity or convey approximately the same meaning.

Therefore, the response is incorrect.

Final score: 0

### Provided data:
- idx: idx_0
- response: ""unknown""
- target (standard answer): ""onegoh""

### Criterion:
- Semantics should be approximately the same or point to the same entity.
- No need for word-for-word correspondence.

### Analysis:
- The target answer is ""onegoh"" (likely a proper noun or key term).
- The response is ""unknown"".
- ""unknown"" does not have approximately the same semantics as ""onegoh"".
- ""unknown"" does not point to the same entity as ""onegoh"".
- Therefore, the response does not satisfy the criterion.

### Final judgment:
- Score: 0 (since the answer is incorrect or unrelated)

```",onegoh,unknown,1.0,"Let's analyze the pair according to the criterion:

- Standard answer (target): ""california""
- Response: ""ca""

Criterion states that it is sufficient if the semantics are approximately the same or if they point to the same entity, no need for exact word match.

- ""ca"" is a commonly accepted abbreviation for ""california.""
- Both clearly point to the same entity (the U.S. state California).
- Since semantics match well and no exact word match necessary, the response should be considered correct.

Final judgment: score = 1
