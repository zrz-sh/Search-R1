The response for every idx is `'nan'`. The target is a non-'nan' string showing one or more entities/names.

According to the grading criteria:  

- It is sufficient if the semantics are approximately the same as the reference answer or if they point to the same entity.
- There is no need for word-for-word correspondence.
- If the response does not match at least one entity in the target, then it is incorrect and should score 0.
- The response here is always `'nan'`, which does not match the target in any way.

Therefore, all responses do not meet the criterion of matching the target entity or conveying the same semantics.

Hence, all scores should be 0.

The response for every idx is `'nan'`. The target is a non-'nan' string showing one or more entities/names.

According to the grading criteria:  

- It is sufficient if the semantics are approximately the same as the reference answer or if they point to the same entity.
- There is no need for word-for-word correspondence.
- If the response does not match at least one entity in the target, then it is incorrect and should score 0.
- The response here is always `'nan'`, which does not match the target in any way.

Therefore, all responses do not meet the criterion of matching the target entity or conveying the same semantics.

Hence, all scores should be 0.

The response for every idx is `'nan'`. The target is a non-'nan' string showing one or more entities/names.

According to the grading criteria:  

- It is sufficient if the semantics are approximately the same as the reference answer or if they point to the same entity.
- There is no need for word-for-word correspondence.
- If the response does not match at least one entity in the target, then it is incorrect and should score 0.
- The response here is always `'nan'`, which does not match the target in any way.

Therefore, all responses do not meet the criterion of matching the target entity or conveying the same semantics.

Hence, all scores should be 0.

The response for every idx is `'nan'`. The target is a non-'nan' string showing one or more entities/names.

According to the grading criteria:  

- It is sufficient if the semantics are approximately the same as the reference answer or if they point to the same entity.
- There is no need for word-for-word correspondence.
- If the response does not match at least one entity in the target, then it is incorrect and should score 0.
- The response here is always `'nan'`, which does not match the target in any way.

Therefore, all responses do not meet the criterion of matching the target entity or conveying the same semantics.

Hence, all scores should be 0.

The response for every idx is `'nan'`. The target is a non-'nan' string showing one or more entities/names.

According to the grading criteria:  

- It is sufficient if the semantics are approximately the same as the reference answer or if they point to the same entity.
- There is no need for word-for-word correspondence.
- If the response does not match at least one entity in the target, then it is incorrect and should score 0.
- The response here is always `'nan'`, which does not match the target in any way.

Therefore, all responses do not meet the criterion of matching the target entity or conveying the same semantics.

Hence, all scores should be 0.

The response for every idx is `'nan'`. The target is a non-'nan' string showing one or more entities/names.

According to the grading criteria:  

- It is sufficient if the semantics are approximately the same as the reference answer or if they point to the same entity.
- There is no need for word-for-word correspondence.
- If the response does not match at least one entity in the target, then it is incorrect and should score 0.
- The response here is always `'nan'`, which does not match the target in any way.

Therefore, all responses do not meet the criterion of matching the target entity or conveying the same semantics.

Hence, all scores should be 0.

The response for every idx is `'nan'`. The target is a non-'nan' string showing one or more entities/names.

According to the grading criteria:  

- It is sufficient if the semantics are approximately the same as the reference answer or if they point to the same entity.
- There is no need for word-for-word correspondence.
- If the response does not match at least one entity in the target, then it is incorrect and should score 0.
- The response here is always `'nan'`, which does not match the target in any way.

Therefore, all responses do not meet the criterion of matching the target entity or conveying the same semantics.

Hence, all scores should be 0.

The response for every idx is `'nan'`. The target is a non-'nan' string showing one or more entities/names.

According to the grading criteria:  

- It is sufficient if the semantics are approximately the same as the reference answer or if they point to the same entity.
- There is no need for word-for-word correspondence.
- If the response does not match at least one entity in the target, then it is incorrect and should score 0.
- The response here is always `'nan'`, which does not match the target in any way.

Therefore, all responses do not meet the criterion of matching the target entity or conveying the same semantics.

Hence, all scores should be 0.

The response for every idx is `'nan'`. The target is a non-'nan' string showing one or more entities/names.

According to the grading criteria:  

- It is sufficient if the semantics are approximately the same as the reference answer or if they point to the same entity.
- There is no need for word-for-word correspondence.
- If the response does not match at least one entity in the target, then it is incorrect and should score 0.
- The response here is always `'nan'`, which does not match the target in any way.

Therefore, all responses do not meet the criterion of matching the target entity or conveying the same semantics.

Hence, all scores should be 0.

The response for every idx is `'nan'`. The target is a non-'nan' string showing one or more entities/names.

According to the grading criteria:  

- It is sufficient if the semantics are approximately the same as the reference answer or if they point to the same entity.
- There is no need for word-for-word correspondence.
- If the response does not match at least one entity in the target, then it is incorrect and should score 0.
- The response here is always `'nan'`, which does not match the target in any way.

Therefore, all responses do not meet the criterion of matching the target entity or conveying the same semantics.

Hence, all scores should be 0.

The response for every idx is `'nan'`. The target is a non-'nan' string showing one or more entities/names.

According to the grading criteria:  

- It is sufficient if the semantics are approximately the same as the reference answer or if they point to the same entity.
- There is no need for word-for-word correspondence.
- If the response does not match at least one entity in the target, then it is incorrect and should score 0.
- The response here is always `'nan'`, which does not match the target in any way.

Therefore, all responses do not meet the criterion of matching the target entity or conveying the same semantics.

Hence, all scores should be 0.

The response for every idx is `'nan'`. The target is a non-'nan' string showing one or more entities/names.

According to the grading criteria:  

- It is sufficient if the semantics are approximately the same as the reference answer or if they point to the same entity.
- There is no need for word-for-word correspondence.
- If the response does not match at least one entity in the target, then it is incorrect and should score 0.
- The response here is always `'nan'`, which does not match the target in any way.

Therefore, all responses do not meet the criterion of matching the target entity or conveying the same semantics.

Hence, all scores should be 0.
