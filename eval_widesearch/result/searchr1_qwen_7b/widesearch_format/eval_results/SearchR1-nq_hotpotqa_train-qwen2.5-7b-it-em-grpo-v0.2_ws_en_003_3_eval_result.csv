**General criterion:**  
- Semantics need to be approximately the same or point to the same entity.  
- No need for exact wording.  
- The target answers are ""olympics"" (plural form).  
- The responses are ""olympic"" (singular/adjective form).

---

**Item idx_0**:  
- Target: ""olympics"" (plural, noun referring to the Olympic games)  
- Response: ""olympic"" (adjective form)  
- Does ""olympic"" convey the same meaning as ""olympics"" in this context?  
- Since ""olympic"" is often used as an adjective (e.g., olympic games), and here it is used alone, it is slightly ambiguous but very likely intended to mean the Olympic games. The criterion states approximate semantics are sufficient.  
- Therefore, the response reasonably points to the same entity.  
- Score: 1

---

**Item idx_1**:  
- Same as idx_0: ""olympic"" vs ""olympics""  
- Same reasoning applies.  
- Score: 1

---

**Item idx_2**:  
- Same as idx_0 and idx_1.  
- Score: 1

---

**Final scoring:**  
All three responses communicate the same concept as the targets (the Olympic games), despite minor grammatical differences.

---

**idx_0:**  
- Response: ""gold""  
- Target: ""goldmedal""  
Analysis: ""gold"" here clearly relates to ""gold medal""; they refer to the same entity (winning the gold medal). The response captures the essential meaning. So this is correct.

Score: 1

Score: 1

---

### idx_0
- **Response:** ""eileengu,[name],[name]""
- **Target:** 
  - gueileen
  - ledeuxtess
  - gremaudmathilde

The standard answer consists of three proper names: ""gueileen,"" ""ledeuxtess,"" and ""gremaudmathilde.""

The response contains ""eileengu"" and two placeholders ""[name],[name]"".

First, check if ""eileengu"" is approximately the same or points to the same entity as any of the target names.

- ""eileengu"" vs ""gueileen"": rearranged, ""gueileen"" could roughly match ""eileengu"" with letters rearranged or typo — but the criterion says ""approximately the same semantics or pointing to the same entity."" The similarity is unclear here, but looks like ""gueileen"" and ""eileengu"" may correspond.

- However, the other two are placeholders ""[name],[name]"" instead of actual target names.

Since the placeholders do not provide actual entities, this response eludes the second and third names completely, and only one name is somewhat approximate. Arguably, the response fails to provide all three names or their equivalents.

Because the criterion says semantics approximately the same or pointing to the same entity is sufficient, but here 2 of 3 names are missing, that means the response is incomplete.

Hence, score = 0.

---

### idx_1
- **Response:** ""eileengu,[name],[name]""
- **Target:** 
  - gueileen
  - cassiesharpe
  - rachaelkarker

Similar to idx_0, the response only has ""eileengu"" + two placeholders.

Check ""eileengu"" vs ""gueileen"": as above, likely corresponds.

The two placeholders do not specify the other two names: ""cassiesharpe"" and ""rachaelkarker.""

Incomplete, missing 2 names.

Score = 0.

---

### idx_2
- **Response:** ""[name],[name],eileengu""
- **Target:** 
  - gremaudmathilde
  - gueileen
  - sildarukelly

Response has two placeholders and ""eileengu.""

Target names are: ""gremaudmathilde,"" ""gueileen,"" ""sildarukelly.""

""eileengu"" probably corresponds to ""gueileen"" (same as above).

The two placeholders are unknown.

Again, missing two names in the response.

Score = 0.

---

### Summary

All responses use the token ""eileengu"" which might correspond to one of the target names, but the other names are all placeholders ""[name]"", meaning they don't correspond to the targets.

Since the criterion requires approximate semantic or pointing to the same entity, using placeholders is insufficient.

Therefore, all responses score 0.
