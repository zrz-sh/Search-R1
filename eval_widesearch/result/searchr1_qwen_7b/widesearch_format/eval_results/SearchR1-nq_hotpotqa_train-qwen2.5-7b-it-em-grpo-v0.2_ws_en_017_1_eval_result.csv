### idx_0  
- Target: ""all hunting prohibited (memorial grounds & waters)."" → Hunting prohibited.  
- Response: ""nohuntingallowedwithinparkboundaries"" → Hunting prohibited.  
**Match** → 1

### idx_1  
- Target: ""hunting prohibited throughout the monument."" → Hunting prohibited.  
- Response: ""nohuntingallowedwithinparkboundaries"" → Hunting prohibited.  
**Match** → 1

### idx_2

### idx_3  
- Target: ""hunting is prohibited within Arches National Park."" → Hunting prohibited.  
- Response: ""huntingallowedunderspecialconditions"" → Hunting allowed under conditions.  
**Conflict** → 0

### idx_4  
- Target: Hunting generally prohibited within Whitesands National Park, but allowed on adjacent missile range under specific permit regulations.  
- Response: ""huntingallowedunderspecialconditions"" → Hunting allowed under special conditions.  
Interpretation: The target says hunting prohibited within park but allowed on adjacent land with permits. Response says hunting allowed under special conditions (doesn't specify if it means inside the park or adjacent areas).  
Criterion is about overall whether hunting allowed or prohibited inside park boundaries. The response is somewhat ambiguous. Since the adjacent land is outside of the park boundary, and the response indicates hunting allowed under special conditions (which could align with hunting allowed on adjacent land, not inside park), this is acceptable.  
Thus, the semantics ""hunting allowed under special conditions"" correspond approximately to the target explanation (hunting prohibited inside, allowed adjacent with conditions). The response points to hunting allowed in some special context, which is consistent.  
**Acceptable** → 1

### idx_5  
- Target: ""hunting prohibited.""  
- Response: ""huntingallowedunderspecialconditions""  
Conflict → 0

### idx_6  
- Target: Hunting prohibited within Yellowstone National Park, but maybe permitted adjacent to park boundaries on other lands with permission.  
- Response: ""huntingallowedunderspecialconditions""  
Again, response says hunting allowed under special conditions - which matches the target mentioning hunting prohibited inside the park but possibly permitted adjacent with permission. This matches the criterion.  
**Acceptable** → 1

### idx_7  
- Target: Hunting and trapping prohibited within Acadia National Park.  
- Response: ""nohuntingallowedwithinparkboundaries"" → Hunting prohibited.  
Match → 1

### idx_8  
- Target: Hunting prohibited within Crater Lake National Park boundaries.  
- Response: ""nohuntingallowedwithinparkboundaries"" → Hunting prohibited.  
Match → 1

### idx_9  
- Target: ""hunting is not permitted within Haleakalā National Park."" → hunting prohibited.  
- Response: ""huntingallowedunderspecialconditions"" → hunting allowed under some conditions.  
Conflict → 0

### idx_10  
- Target: Hunting prohibited within Great Smoky Mountains National Park, but hunting permitted nearby.  
- Response: ""nohuntingallowedwithinparkboundaries"" → hunting prohibited.  
Aligns with the core prohibition inside park → 1

### idx_11  
- Target: Hunting prohibited within Redwood National and State Parks.  
- Response: ""nohuntingallowedwithinparkboundaries"" → hunting prohibited.  
Match → 1

### idx_12  
- Target: Hunting prohibited within Canyonlands National Park. Fishing allowed.  
- Response: ""huntingallowedunderspecialconditions"" → hunting allowed under special conditions.  
Conflict → 0 (since the target clearly says hunting is prohibited inside the park, no special condition allowing hunting is described; fishing allowed is unrelated to hunting.)

- ""huntingallowedunderspecialconditions"" → Hunting is allowed under certain conditions/allowed in some form.

---

### idx_0  
- Target: ""all hunting prohibited (memorial grounds & waters)."" → Hunting prohibited.  
- Response: ""nohuntingallowedwithinparkboundaries"" → Hunting prohibited.  
**Match** → 1

### idx_1  
- Target: ""hunting prohibited throughout the monument."" → Hunting prohibited.  
- Response: ""nohuntingallowedwithinparkboundaries"" → Hunting prohibited.  
**Match** → 1

### idx_2  
- Target: ""hunting prohibited."" → Hunting prohibited.  
- Response: ""huntingallowedunderspecialconditions"" → Hunting allowed under conditions.  
**Conflict** → 0

### idx_3  
- Target: ""hunting is prohibited within Arches National Park."" → Hunting prohibited.  
- Response: ""huntingallowedunderspecialconditions"" → Hunting allowed under conditions.  
**Conflict** → 0

### idx_4  
- Target: Hunting generally prohibited within Whitesands National Park, but allowed on adjacent missile range under specific permit regulations.  
- Response: ""huntingallowedunderspecialconditions"" → Hunting allowed under special conditions.  
Interpretation: The target says hunting prohibited within park but allowed on adjacent land with permits. Response says hunting allowed under special conditions (doesn't specify if it means inside the park or adjacent areas).  
Criterion is about overall whether hunting allowed or prohibited inside park boundaries. The response is somewhat ambiguous. Since the adjacent land is outside of the park boundary, and the response indicates hunting allowed under special conditions (which could align with hunting allowed on adjacent land, not inside park), this is acceptable.  
Thus, the semantics ""hunting allowed under special conditions"" correspond approximately to the target explanation (hunting prohibited inside, allowed adjacent with conditions). The response points to hunting allowed in some special context, which is consistent.  
**Acceptable** → 1

### idx_5  
- Target: ""hunting prohibited.""  
- Response: ""huntingallowedunderspecialconditions""  
Conflict → 0

### idx_6  
- Target: Hunting prohibited within Yellowstone National Park, but maybe permitted adjacent to park boundaries on other lands with permission.  
- Response: ""huntingallowedunderspecialconditions""  
Again, response says hunting allowed under special conditions - which matches the target mentioning hunting prohibited inside the park but possibly permitted adjacent with permission. This matches the criterion.  
**Acceptable** → 1

### idx_7  
- Target: Hunting and trapping prohibited within Acadia National Park.  
- Response: ""nohuntingallowedwithinparkboundaries"" → Hunting prohibited.  
Match → 1

### idx_8  
- Target: Hunting prohibited within Crater Lake National Park boundaries.  
- Response: ""nohuntingallowedwithinparkboundaries"" → Hunting prohibited.  
Match → 1

### idx_9  
- Target: ""hunting is not permitted within Haleakalā National Park."" → hunting prohibited.  
- Response: ""huntingallowedunderspecialconditions"" → hunting allowed under some conditions.  
Conflict → 0

### idx_10  
- Target: Hunting prohibited within Great Smoky Mountains National Park, but hunting permitted nearby.  
- Response: ""nohuntingallowedwithinparkboundaries"" → hunting prohibited.  
Aligns with the core prohibition inside park → 1

### idx_11  
- Target: Hunting prohibited within Redwood National and State Parks.  
- Response: ""nohuntingallowedwithinparkboundaries"" → hunting prohibited.  
Match → 1

### idx_12  
- Target: Hunting prohibited within Canyonlands National Park. Fishing allowed.  
- Response: ""huntingallowedunderspecialconditions"" → hunting allowed under special conditions.  
Conflict → 0 (since the target clearly says hunting is prohibited inside the park, no special condition allowing hunting is described; fishing allowed is unrelated to hunting.)

Thus, the semantics ""hunting allowed under special conditions"" correspond approximately to the target explanation (hunting prohibited inside, allowed adjacent with conditions). The response points to hunting allowed in some special context, which is consistent.  
**Acceptable** → 1

### idx_5  
- Target: ""hunting prohibited.""  
- Response: ""huntingallowedunderspecialconditions""  
Conflict → 0

### idx_6  
- Target: Hunting prohibited within Yellowstone National Park, but maybe permitted adjacent to park boundaries on other lands with permission.  
- Response: ""huntingallowedunderspecialconditions""  
Again, response says hunting allowed under special conditions - which matches the target mentioning hunting prohibited inside the park but possibly permitted adjacent with permission. This matches the criterion.  
**Acceptable** → 1

### idx_7  
- Target: Hunting and trapping prohibited within Acadia National Park.  
- Response: ""nohuntingallowedwithinparkboundaries"" → Hunting prohibited.

### idx_8

### idx_10

### idx_11

Match → 1

### idx_12  
- Target: Hunting prohibited within Canyonlands National Park. Fishing allowed.  
- Response: ""huntingallowedunderspecialconditions"" → hunting allowed under special conditions.  
Conflict → 0 (since the target clearly says hunting is prohibited inside the park, no special condition allowing hunting is described; fishing allowed is unrelated to hunting.)

Criterion is about overall whether hunting allowed or prohibited inside park boundaries. The response is somewhat ambiguous. Since the adjacent land is outside of the park boundary, and the response indicates hunting allowed under special conditions (which could align with hunting allowed on adjacent land, not inside park), this is acceptable.

### idx_4  
- Target: Hunting generally prohibited within Whitesands National Park, but allowed on adjacent missile range under specific permit regulations.  
- Response: ""huntingallowedunderspecialconditions"" → Hunting allowed under special conditions.  
Interpretation: The target says hunting prohibited within park but allowed on adjacent land with permits. Response says hunting allowed under special conditions (doesn't specify if it means inside the park or adjacent areas).  
Criterion is about overall whether hunting allowed or prohibited inside park boundaries. The response is somewhat ambiguous. Since the adjacent land is outside of the park boundary, and the response indicates hunting allowed under special conditions (which could align with hunting allowed on adjacent land, not inside park), this is acceptable.  
Thus, the semantics ""hunting allowed under special conditions"" correspond approximately to the target explanation (hunting prohibited inside, allowed adjacent with conditions). The response points to hunting allowed in some special context, which is consistent.  
**Acceptable** → 1

- Target: Hunting prohibited within Canyonlands National Park. Fishing allowed.  
- Response: ""huntingallowedunderspecialconditions"" → hunting allowed under special conditions.

### idx_0  
- Target: ""all hunting prohibited (memorial grounds & waters)."" → Hunting prohibited.  
- Response: ""nohuntingallowedwithinparkboundaries"" → Hunting prohibited.  
**Match** → 1

### idx_1  
- Target: ""hunting prohibited throughout the monument."" → Hunting prohibited.

- Target: ""hunting is prohibited within Arches National Park."" → Hunting prohibited.  
- Response: ""huntingallowedunderspecialconditions"" → Hunting allowed under conditions.

### idx_4  
- Target: Hunting generally prohibited within Whitesands National Park, but allowed on adjacent missile range under specific permit regulations.  
- Response: ""huntingallowedunderspecialconditions"" → Hunting allowed under special conditions.  
Interpretation: The target says hunting prohibited within park but allowed on adjacent land with permits. Response says hunting allowed under special conditions (doesn't specify if it means inside the park or adjacent areas).  
Criterion is about overall whether hunting allowed or prohibited inside park boundaries. The response is somewhat ambiguous. Since the adjacent land is outside of the park boundary, and the response indicates hunting allowed under special conditions (which could align with hunting allowed on adjacent land, not inside park), this is acceptable.  
Thus, the semantics ""hunting allowed under special conditions"" correspond approximately to the target explanation (hunting prohibited inside, allowed adjacent with conditions). The response points to hunting allowed in some special context, which is consistent.  
**Acceptable** → 1

- Target: ""hunting prohibited.""

Conflict → 0

### idx_6  
- Target: Hunting prohibited within Yellowstone National Park, but maybe permitted adjacent to park boundaries on other lands with permission.

Again, response says hunting allowed under special conditions - which matches the target mentioning hunting prohibited inside the park but possibly permitted adjacent with permission. This matches the criterion.

### idx_12  
- Target: Hunting prohibited within Canyonlands National Park. Fishing allowed.  
- Response: ""huntingallowedunderspecialconditions"" → hunting allowed under special conditions.

**Analysis:**

- **idx_0**: Response: ""hawaii"", Target: ""hawaiʻi""  
  The difference is the diacritic. The response ""hawaii"" clearly points to the same entity ""Hawaiʻi"" (state). This satisfies the criterion.  
  **Score: 1**

- **idx_1**: Response: ""california"", Target: ""california""  
  Exact match.  
  **Score: 1**

- **idx_2**: Response: ""southdakota"", Target: ""southdakota""  
  Exact match (though written without space, presumably one token). Semantic same.  
  **Score: 1**

- **idx_3**: Response: ""utah"", Target: ""utah""  
  Exact match.  
  **Score: 1**

- **idx_4**: Response: ""newmexico"", Target: ""newmexico""  
  Exact match (no space but semantic match).

- **idx_9**: Response: ""hawaii"", Target: ""hawaiʻi""  
  Same as idx_0, semantic same entity despite diacritic difference.  
  **Score: 1**

- **idx_10**: Response: ""tennessee,northcarolina"", Target: ""northcarolina,tennessee""  
  The list is the same states but order differs. Criterion does not mention order sensitivity; points to same entities.

Given criterion:  
- Semantics must be approximately the same or point to the same entity.  
- No need for word-for-word match.

Data:  
- All responses are ""nan"" (likely meaning ""no answer"" or empty).
- Targets are all specific names, such as ""tomleatherman"", ""davidsmith"", etc.

Analysis per item:

- idx_0: response = 'nan', target = 'tomleatherman'  
  Response does not refer to or match the target entity. It's empty or ""nan"". Score = 0

- idx_1: 'nan' vs 'davidsmith' → no match. Score = 0

- idx_2: 'nan' vs 'michellewheatley' → no match. Score = 0

- idx_3: 'nan' vs 'lenapace' → no match. Score = 0

- idx_4: 'nan' vs 'gerardogonzalez' → no match. Score = 0

- idx_5: 'nan' vs 'jeffbradybaugh' → no match. Score = 0
