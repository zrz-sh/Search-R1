Criterion summary:  
- The response is sufficient if the semantics are approximately the same or if it points to the same entity.  
- No need for exact wording.

- Target: ""grades9-12""

   - Responses to be graded:
     - idx_0: ""1.0""

2. **Criterion:**

   - Semantics need to be approximately the same or point to the same entity.
   - No need for word-for-word matching.
   - Scores: 0 or 1 only.

3. **Analysis per idx:**

   - `idx_0`:

     - Comparison: Exactly the same.
     - Result: Score = 1
   
   - `idx_1`:

     - Comparison: Different numbers, not semantically equivalent or pointing to the same entity.
