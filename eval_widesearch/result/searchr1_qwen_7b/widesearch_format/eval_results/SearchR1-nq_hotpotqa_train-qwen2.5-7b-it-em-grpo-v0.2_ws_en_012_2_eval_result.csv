,,2023,2023,1.0,"Let's analyze each pair according to the criterion:

Criterion recap:  
- Semantics approximately the same or refer to the same entity is sufficient.  
- Similar semantics and approximate expressions regarding background/occupation are acceptable.

---

### idx_0

- Target answer: ""veterinarian;founderprojectstreetvet""  
- Response: ""doctor""  

Analysis:  
- A veterinarian is a type of doctor (doctor for animals). The response ""doctor"" is a broader term but includes ""veterinarian"" semantically.  
- The target includes ""founder project streetvet"" which adds information about being a founder and a project name. The response does not mention that part.  
- However, the criterion states it's sufficient if semantics are approximately the same or point to the same entity, and that approximation in background/occupation is accepted. Since ""doctor"" covers ""veterinarian"" semantically (although less specific), this should be accepted as correct under the criterion.

Conclusion: score = 1

---

### idx_1

- Target answer: ""non-profitexec;founderdogsmatter""  
- Response: ""socialentrepreneur""  

Analysis:  
- ""non-profit executive"" is someone who runs a non-profit organization, and ""founder dogs matter"" means founding a named organization.  
- ""social entrepreneur"" means someone who starts and runs ventures aimed at social goals, often non-profits or social enterprises.  
- This is a very close semantic match; ""social entrepreneur"" overlaps well with ""non-profit executive/founder""  
- According to criterion, approximate expressions on background/occupation are fine.  
- Thus, it is semantically approximately the same and points to the same entity type.

Conclusion: score = 1

### idx_0  
- Target: **""free veterinary care for pets of people experiencing homelessness""**  
- Response: **""provided care and services for underserved communities""**

Analysis:  
- The target is specifically about free veterinary care for pets of homeless people.  
- The response mentions ""provided care and services for underserved communities""—this is broader and vaguer.  
- The response might include veterinary care for homeless people's pets but does not specify it and could include other types of services or other communities.  
- The response is related but does not clearly point to the exact entity ""free veterinary care for pets of people experiencing homelessness.""  
- The semantics are related (care to underserved groups), but it is not sufficiently precise to be considered the same as the target answer.  
- Therefore, this is **not fully consistent** with the target answer.

### idx_1  
- Target: **""temporary foster care for pets while owners enter addiction treatment""**  
- Response: **""founded dogs matter to help dogs and people in need""**

Analysis:  
- The target answer specifies a very particular program: temporary foster care for pets during owners’ addiction treatment.  
- The response states ""founded dogs matter to help dogs and people in need""—this is a broad mission statement (founding an organization) and does not specify the temporary foster care for pets during addiction treatment.  
- The response is related to helping dogs and people, but lacks the specific semantic detail of the temporary foster care related to addiction treatment.  
- The meaning is related but not approximately the same or pointing to the same entity or program described.  
- Thus, it does not meet the criterion for full similarity.
