Criterion: 
- It is sufficient if the semantics are approximately the same as the reference answer or if they point to the same entity.
- No need for word-for-word matching.

**idx_0**  
Response: ""maleficent""  
Target: ""maleficent""  
- Exact match. Same entity.  
- Score: 1

Response: ""sophie""

- Different names, no indication these are the same entity.  
- No semantic similarity or synonymy.

- Different names, no semantic equivalence.

- Different, no clear semantic link. The target looks like a compound name, but no clear match.

**idx_4**  
Response: ""jasminedupé""  
Target: ""jasmine""  
- The response includes ""jasmine"" plus an additional part ""dupé,"" which may be last name or additional info.

- idx_0: response = ""angelinajolie"", target = ""angelinajolie""  
  The response matches the target exactly. Score: 1

  Exact match, score: 1

Criterion summary:  
- Semantics approximately the same as the reference or pointing to the same entity is sufficient for a full score (1).  
- Exact word match is NOT required.

---

### idx_0  
- Response: ""nan""  
- Target: ""nickelodeonkids'choiceawards-favoritevillain""  
- Analysis: Response is ""nan"" indicating no answer or missing answer. Target has a specific award. Not matching semantically or referring to the same entity.  
- Score: 0

### idx_1  
- Response: ""nan""  
- Target: ""nan""  
- Analysis: Both response and target are ""nan"". Usually ""nan"" means ""no answer"" or ""not applicable"". Since they match exactly, this indicates response matches target by absence of content.  
- Score: 1

### idx_2  
- Response: ""nan""  
- Target:  
  ```
  1.globalnonviolentfilmfestival：bestleadactress
  2.heartlandfilmfestival：trulymovingpictureaward
  3.cineuphoriaawards：bestactress–internationalcompetition
  ```  
- Analysis: Response is empty (nan), target has multiple specific awards. Not matching.  
- Score: 0

### idx_3  
- Response: ""nan""  
- Target: ""huadingaward-bestglobalactressinamotionpicture""  
- Analysis: Response is empty, target specific award. Not matching.  
- Score: 0

### idx_4  
- Response: ""academyawardforbestactress""  
- Target: Many awards listed including ""oscar-bestperformancebyanactressinaleadingrole"" (Oscar = Academy Award).  
- Analysis:  
  - Response is ""academyawardforbestactress"" which is synonymous with ""oscar-bestperformancebyanactressinaleadingrole"".  
  - The target includes many awards; a complete overlap is not necessary as per criterion.  
  - Pointing to the same entity (academy/oscar) - counts as semantically same.  
- Score: 1

### idx_5  
- Response: ""baftaawardforbestactressinaleadingrole""  
- Target:
