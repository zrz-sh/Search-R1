**idx_0**: response 'tiktok', target 'tiktok'  
- Exact match, same entity.  
- Score: 1

**idx_1**: response 'facebook', target 'whatsapp'  
- Different entities (Facebook vs WhatsApp).  
- Not same or semantically equivalent.  
- Score: 0

**idx_2**: response 'whatsapp', target 'facebook'  
- Different entities.

- Different entities.  
- Score: 0

**idx_6**: response 'tiktok', target 'tiktok'  
- Exact match.  
- Score: 1

**idx_7**: response 'meta', target 'instagram'  
- Meta is the parent company of Instagram, but the criterion says ""point to the same entity or semantics approximately the same.""  
- Meta and Instagram are not the same entity; meta is a company, Instagram is a platform owned by Meta. This could be considered related but not pointing to the same entity.  
- The criterion says ""sufficient if pointing to the same entity"". Meta and Instagram are different entities though related.  
- Given the criterion allows approximate semantics or same entity, but ""meta"" and ""instagram"" are different entities. The response is less precise and does not directly answer the question as the target expected is Instagram, not the company.  
- Therefore: Score 0

**idx_8**: response 'whatsapp', target 'whatsapp'  
- Exact match.

  ""social"" is directly part of ""social media"" and clearly points to the same semantic domain. According to the criterion (""semantics approximately the same or point to the same entity""), this is sufficient.  
  Score: 1

- idx_1: response ""social"" vs target ""messaging""  
  ""social"" and ""messaging"" are related but not the same entity. ""social"" is broad (related to social interaction or networks), while ""messaging"" refers to sending messages, a specific function. Since they do not point to the same entity nor have approximately the same semantics, according to criterion, this is insufficient.

  ""communication"" is a broader term that covers ""social media"" as a tool of communication. It overlaps in semantic field but is not exactly the same concept. The criterion allows approximate semantics or pointing to the same entity. Since ""communication"" includes social media as a sub-category or usage context, this can be regarded as sufficient.
