plannedparenthood-fultonstreethealthcenter,Planned Parenthood - Fulton St,,,1.0,key_match,1.0,"exact match, response: fresno, target: fresno",fresno,fresno,1.0,"Let's analyze the response against the target based on the criterion.

- Target: ""650n.fultonstreet,fresno,ca93728""
- Response: ""650n.fultonstreet,fresno,ca93728""

Step-by-step analysis:
- The response exactly matches the target.
- According to the criterion: ""It is sufficient if the semantics are approximately the same as the reference answer or if they point to the same entity.""
- Here, the response is exactly the same, so full correctness.

Final Score: 1

- Standard answer (idx_0): ""8am-4:30pm""
- Response (idx_0): ""nodata""

Step 1: Check if the response semantically matches or points to the same entity as the standard answer.  
- The standard answer is a time range (likely working hours or similar).  
- The response ""nodata"" does not provide any time information or an equivalent semantic meaning.

Step 2: According to the criterion, the response must have roughly the same semantics or point to the same entity. ""nodata"" does not satisfy this.

Step 3: Score needs to be either 0 or 1.  
- Since the response has no relevant or approximate semantic match, the score is 0.
