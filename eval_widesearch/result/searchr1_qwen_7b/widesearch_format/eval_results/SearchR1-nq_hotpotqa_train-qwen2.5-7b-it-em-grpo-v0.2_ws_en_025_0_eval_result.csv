- Response: ""650n.fultonst,fresno,ca93728""  
- Target: ""650n.fultonstreet,fresno,ca93728""

The criterion states: ""It is sufficient if the semantics are approximately the same as the reference answer or if they point to the same entity.""  
Here, ""fultonst"" is an abbreviation of ""fultonstreet."" The rest of the address matches exactly. The semantics are the same; they refer to the same address.

Therefore, according to the criterion, the response is correct and should be scored 1.

- Standard answer (target): ""8am-4:30pm""
- Response: ""notspecified""

Analysis:
- The response does not provide any time or refer to any time frame.
- The standard answer specifies a clear time range.
- According to the criterion, the response's semantics should approximately match the reference or point to the same entity. Here, the response is essentially an indication of no specification.
- Since ""notspecified"" does not match the time range, nor approximate the meaning, it cannot be considered correct.

Therefore, the score should be 0.
