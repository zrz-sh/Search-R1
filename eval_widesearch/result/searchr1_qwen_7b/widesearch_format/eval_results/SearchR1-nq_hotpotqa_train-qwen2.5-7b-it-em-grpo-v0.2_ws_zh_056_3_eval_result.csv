Criterion: The response should be semantically roughly the same or refer to the same entity as the target. Exact word-for-word match is not required.

- idx_0:
  - Response: ""北京大学""
  - Target: ""北京大学""
  - Analysis: The response is exactly the same as the target, referring to the same university.
  - Score: 1

- idx_1:
  - Response: ""复旦大学""
  - Target: ""复旦大学""
  - Analysis: The response matches the target exactly, referring to the same university.
  - Score: 1

- idx_0:  
  Response: ""陈省身数学奖""  
  Target: ""陈省身数学奖""  
  The response exactly matches the target phrase. According to the criterion, semantic sameness or pointing to the same entity suffices. Here, it is an exact match, so score is 1.

- idx_1:  
  Response: ""nan""  
  Target: ""nan""  
  Both are ""nan"", which means presumably no answer or not applicable. Since the response and target are the same, they are semantically matched. So score is 1.

Final scoring results:
