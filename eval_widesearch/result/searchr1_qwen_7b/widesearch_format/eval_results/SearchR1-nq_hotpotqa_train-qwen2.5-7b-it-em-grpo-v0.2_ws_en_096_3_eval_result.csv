Is 24 approx equal to 20.88? Percentage difference is (24-20.88)/20.88 ≈ 15%. This is somewhat significant.

Given the criterion allows ""approximately the same,"" and considering typical rounding tolerance, 1.0 mp difference is acceptable, 3+ mp might not be. So this may be scored as 0.

**Common Response Across All Items:**
- Response: ""1/8000secto90sec""

This seems to indicate the shutter speed range from 1/8000 sec to 90 sec.

---

**Target Analysis Per idx:**

- idx_0:
  Target: ""1/32000−30s(stepof1/3,1/2,or1ev;extendableto900sinmmode),bulb,remotebulb""
  The target states a shutter speed starting from 1/32000 (very fast) to 30s, with step increments and extendable to 900s in mm mode, also mentions bulb and remote bulb.
  The response says 1/8000 to 90s, which is different on both minimum and maximum ends and does not mention the steps or bulb.
  Since the response range is narrower (1/8000 vs 1/32000) and longer max (90s vs 30s), but no mention of increments or bulb.
  By criterion, approximate semantics or same entity needed. Since the response mentions a related shutter speed range but not the exact range or detail, it's partially correct but different enough for this grading (0 or 1).
  The target is a more extensive, precise range with details; response omits these details.
  This is a mismatch.

- idx_1:
  Target identical to idx_0, response identical.
  Same judgment applies: mismatch.

- idx_2:
  Target: ""1/8000−30s(fine-tunewith1/3or1/2ev;extendableto900sinmmode),bulb,remotebulb,x200""
  Response: ""1/8000secto90sec""
  Here the response minimum 1/8000 matches target, max 90s > 30s, so max shutter time is longer, missing specific tuning steps, bulb, remote bulb, and x200.
  Semantically related, but missing tuning and bulb related info.
  Given the criterion allows approximate semantics, and the range overlaps partly with the exact start of the range, this might be acceptable, but 90s vs 30s still a discrepancy.
  However, since the semantics (shutter speed range) and mentioned entity converge, maybe acceptable.

- idx_3:
  Same target as idx_2 and same response as idx_2.
  Same judgment: acceptable.

- idx_4:
  Target: ""1/8000−30s(fine-tunewith1/3or1/2ev),bulb,remotebulb,x200""
  Response: same ""1/8000secto90sec""
  Again, min shutter speed matches, max shutter speed is longer in response (90s vs 30s).
  Bulb and remote bulb missing in response, tuning missing.
  Approximate semantics might be accepted depending on strictness.

- idx_5:
  Same as idx_4, same response.
  Same as above.

- idx_6:
  Target: ""1/4000−30s(fine-tunewith1/3or1/2ev),bulb,remotebulb""
  Response: ""1/8000secto90sec""
  Here target minimum is 1/4000, response minimum 1/8000 (faster).
  Target max 30s, response max 90s.
  Response covers wider shutter speed range, but misses tuning and bulb information.
  Approximate range is generally covered, but missing tuning and bulb info.

- idx_7:
  Target: ""1/4000−30s(fine-tunewith1/3ev),bulb,remotebulb""
  Response same, so same analysis as idx_6.

---

**Summary of Judgments:**

- The response always gives shutter speed range as 1/8000 to 90s.
- Targets have different ranges (starting at 1/32000, 1/8000, or 1/4000) and different max (30s or 90s), and additional details (step sizes, bulb modes, x200).
- The criterion states approx. semantics are sufficient.
- Bulb, remote bulb, step sizes are part of the answer but not mentioned in the response at all.
- The response at least gives a shutter speed range overlapping or close to the target.
- For idx_0 and idx_1 target is 1/32000 to 30s; response min is 1/8000, which is four times slower, so not covering the fastest speeds.
- For idx_2 to idx_5 the response min 1/8000 matches the targets, max 90s exceeds 30s.
- For idx_6 and idx_7, response min 1/8000 is faster than target min 1/4000 (so response includes the target range), max 90s > 30s.

Does the difference in min shutter speed matter for approx semantics? Possibly yes, since from 1/32000 to 1/8000 is a big difference, from 1/8000 to 1/4000 less so.

Also, the response omits bulbs and tuning.

Given the grading scale is 0 or 1 and the criterion allows approximate semantics sufficiency, the main determining factor is whether the response points to the same entity i.e. shutter speed range roughly correct.

Bulb and step tuning are supporting details and not required as per criterion.

---

**Final scoring:**

- idx_0: Response misses the extremely fast min shutter speed (1/32000 vs 1/8000), might be considered insufficient approx. semantics → 0
- idx_1: Same as idx_0 → 0
- idx_2: Min matches exactly (1/8000), max longer, supporting details missing but not required → 1
- idx_3: Same as idx_2 → 1
- idx_4: Same as idx_2 →1
- idx_5: Same as idx_4 →1
- idx_6: Response min faster than target min (1/8000 vs 1/4000), response max longer → covers approximate semantics → 1

  The target ISO range is 64-25600, the response gives ""100-320000(expandableto50)"". The numbers are quite different and do not fall within the same or approximate ISO ranges. ""expandableto50"" possibly means ISO 50, which is outside the target range. The response states a much broader range starting from ISO 100 to 320000, which does not match or approximate the target's ISO range.

  Target is ISO 100-51200. Response says 100-320000 (expandable to 50).  
  The response's native ISO range starts at 100, like the target, but extends much higher (to 320000). The expandable ISO 50 is lower than the target start but close.  
  The response's range encompasses and exceeds the target range, so they refer to roughly the same ISO entity/range, just with expanded capability.

**Common Response Across All Items:**
- Response: ""1/8000secto90sec""

This seems to indicate the shutter speed range from 1/8000 sec to 90 sec.

---

**Target Analysis Per idx:**

- idx_0:
  Target: ""1/32000−30s(stepof1/3,1/2,or1ev;extendableto900sinmmode),bulb,remotebulb""
  The target states a shutter speed starting from 1/32000 (very fast) to 30s, with step increments and extendable to 900s in mm mode, also mentions bulb and remote bulb.
  The response says 1/8000 to 90s, which is different on both minimum and maximum ends and does not mention the steps or bulb.
  Since the response range is narrower (1/8000 vs 1/32000) and longer max (90s vs 30s), but no mention of increments or bulb.
  By criterion, approximate semantics or same entity needed. Since the response mentions a related shutter speed range but not the exact range or detail, it's partially correct but different enough for this grading (0 or 1).
  The target is a more extensive, precise range with details; response omits these details.
  This is a mismatch.

- idx_1:
  Target identical to idx_0, response identical.
  Same judgment applies: mismatch.

- idx_2:
  Target: ""1/8000−30s(fine-tunewith1/3or1/2ev;extendableto900sinmmode),bulb,remotebulb,x200""
  Response: ""1/8000secto90sec""
  Here the response minimum 1/8000 matches target, max 90s > 30s, so max shutter time is longer, missing specific tuning steps, bulb, remote bulb, and x200.
  Semantically related, but missing tuning and bulb related info.
  Given the criterion allows approximate semantics, and the range overlaps partly with the exact start of the range, this might be acceptable, but 90s vs 30s still a discrepancy.
  However, since the semantics (shutter speed range) and mentioned entity converge, maybe acceptable.

- idx_3:
  Same target as idx_2 and same response as idx_2.
  Same judgment: acceptable.

- idx_4:
  Target: ""1/8000−30s(fine-tunewith1/3or1/2ev),bulb,remotebulb,x200""
  Response: same ""1/8000secto90sec""
  Again, min shutter speed matches, max shutter speed is longer in response (90s vs 30s).
  Bulb and remote bulb missing in response, tuning missing.
  Approximate semantics might be accepted depending on strictness.

- idx_5:
  Same as idx_4, same response.
  Same as above.

- idx_6:
  Target: ""1/4000−30s(fine-tunewith1/3or1/2ev),bulb,remotebulb""
  Response: ""1/8000secto90sec""
  Here target minimum is 1/4000, response minimum 1/8000 (faster).
  Target max 30s, response max 90s.
  Response covers wider shutter speed range, but misses tuning and bulb information.
  Approximate range is generally covered, but missing tuning and bulb info.

- idx_7:
  Target: ""1/4000−30s(fine-tunewith1/3ev),bulb,remotebulb""
  Response same, so same analysis as idx_6.

---

**Summary of Judgments:**

- The response always gives shutter speed range as 1/8000 to 90s.
- Targets have different ranges (starting at 1/32000, 1/8000, or 1/4000) and different max (30s or 90s), and additional details (step sizes, bulb modes, x200).
- The criterion states approx. semantics are sufficient.
- Bulb, remote bulb, step sizes are part of the answer but not mentioned in the response at all.
- The response at least gives a shutter speed range overlapping or close to the target.
- For idx_0 and idx_1 target is 1/32000 to 30s; response min is 1/8000, which is four times slower, so not covering the fastest speeds.
- For idx_2 to idx_5 the response min 1/8000 matches the targets, max 90s exceeds 30s.
- For idx_6 and idx_7, response min 1/8000 is faster than target min 1/4000 (so response includes the target range), max 90s > 30s.

Does the difference in min shutter speed matter for approx semantics? Possibly yes, since from 1/32000 to 1/8000 is a big difference, from 1/8000 to 1/4000 less so.

Also, the response omits bulbs and tuning.

Given the grading scale is 0 or 1 and the criterion allows approximate semantics sufficiency, the main determining factor is whether the response points to the same entity i.e. shutter speed range roughly correct.

Bulb and step tuning are supporting details and not required as per criterion.

---

**Final scoring:**

- idx_0: Response misses the extremely fast min shutter speed (1/32000 vs 1/8000), might be considered insufficient approx. semantics → 0
- idx_1: Same as idx_0 → 0
- idx_2: Min matches exactly (1/8000), max longer, supporting details missing but not required → 1
- idx_3: Same as idx_2 → 1

- idx_5: Same as idx_4 →1
- idx_6: Response min faster than target min (1/8000 vs 1/4000), response max longer → covers approximate semantics → 1

7. idx_6:

24mp vs 20.88 million pixels. This is a bigger difference (over 3 mp difference). However, the response is still an approximate figure pointing to megapixels quantity. But they are not the same or approximately the same number. Per criterion, ""approximately the same"" is key.

Is 24 approx equal to 20.88? Percentage difference is (24-20.88)/20.88 ≈ 15%. This is somewhat significant.

Given the criterion allows ""approximately the same,"" and considering typical rounding tolerance, 1.0 mp difference is acceptable, 3+ mp might not be. So this may be scored as 0.

**Summary of Judgments:**

- The response always gives shutter speed range as 1/8000 to 90s.
- Targets have different ranges (starting at 1/32000, 1/8000, or 1/4000) and different max (30s or 90s), and additional details (step sizes, bulb modes, x200).
- The criterion states approx. semantics are sufficient.
- Bulb, remote bulb, step sizes are part of the answer but not mentioned in the response at all.
- The response at least gives a shutter speed range overlapping or close to the target.
- For idx_0 and idx_1 target is 1/32000 to 30s; response min is 1/8000, which is four times slower, so not covering the fastest speeds.
- For idx_2 to idx_5 the response min 1/8000 matches the targets, max 90s exceeds 30s.
- For idx_6 and idx_7, response min 1/8000 is faster than target min 1/4000 (so response includes the target range), max 90s > 30s.

Does the difference in min shutter speed matter for approx semantics? Possibly yes, since from 1/32000 to 1/8000 is a big difference, from 1/8000 to 1/4000 less so.

Also, the response omits bulbs and tuning.

Given the grading scale is 0 or 1 and the criterion allows approximate semantics sufficiency, the main determining factor is whether the response points to the same entity i.e. shutter speed range roughly correct.

7. idx_6:

24mp vs 20.88 million pixels. This is a bigger difference (over 3 mp difference). However, the response is still an approximate figure pointing to megapixels quantity. But they are not the same or approximately the same number. Per criterion, ""approximately the same"" is key.

Is 24 approx equal to 20.88? Percentage difference is (24-20.88)/20.88 ≈ 15%. This is somewhat significant.

Given the criterion allows ""approximately the same,"" and considering typical rounding tolerance, 1.0 mp difference is acceptable, 3+ mp might not be. So this may be scored as 0.

**Common Response Across All Items:**
- Response: ""1/8000secto90sec""

This seems to indicate the shutter speed range from 1/8000 sec to 90 sec.

---

**Target Analysis Per idx:**

- idx_0:
  Target: ""1/32000−30s(stepof1/3,1/2,or1ev;extendableto900sinmmode),bulb,remotebulb""
  The target states a shutter speed starting from 1/32000 (very fast) to 30s, with step increments and extendable to 900s in mm mode, also mentions bulb and remote bulb.
  The response says 1/8000 to 90s, which is different on both minimum and maximum ends and does not mention the steps or bulb.
  Since the response range is narrower (1/8000 vs 1/32000) and longer max (90s vs 30s), but no mention of increments or bulb.
  By criterion, approximate semantics or same entity needed. Since the response mentions a related shutter speed range but not the exact range or detail, it's partially correct but different enough for this grading (0 or 1).
  The target is a more extensive, precise range with details; response omits these details.
  This is a mismatch.

- idx_1:
  Target identical to idx_0, response identical.
  Same judgment applies: mismatch.

- idx_2:
  Target: ""1/8000−30s(fine-tunewith1/3or1/2ev;extendableto900sinmmode),bulb,remotebulb,x200""
  Response: ""1/8000secto90sec""
  Here the response minimum 1/8000 matches target, max 90s > 30s, so max shutter time is longer, missing specific tuning steps, bulb, remote bulb, and x200.
  Semantically related, but missing tuning and bulb related info.
  Given the criterion allows approximate semantics, and the range overlaps partly with the exact start of the range, this might be acceptable, but 90s vs 30s still a discrepancy.
  However, since the semantics (shutter speed range) and mentioned entity converge, maybe acceptable.

- idx_3:
  Same target as idx_2 and same response as idx_2.
  Same judgment: acceptable.

- idx_4:
  Target: ""1/8000−30s(fine-tunewith1/3or1/2ev),bulb,remotebulb,x200""
  Response: same ""1/8000secto90sec""
  Again, min shutter speed matches, max shutter speed is longer in response (90s vs 30s).
  Bulb and remote bulb missing in response, tuning missing.
  Approximate semantics might be accepted depending on strictness.

- idx_5:
  Same as idx_4, same response.
  Same as above.

- idx_6:
  Target: ""1/4000−30s(fine-tunewith1/3or1/2ev),bulb,remotebulb""
  Response: ""1/8000secto90sec""
  Here target minimum is 1/4000, response minimum 1/8000 (faster).
  Target max 30s, response max 90s.
  Response covers wider shutter speed range, but misses tuning and bulb information.
  Approximate range is generally covered, but missing tuning and bulb info.

- idx_7:
  Target: ""1/4000−30s(fine-tunewith1/3ev),bulb,remotebulb""
  Response same, so same analysis as idx_6.

---

**Summary of Judgments:**

- The response always gives shutter speed range as 1/8000 to 90s.
- Targets have different ranges (starting at 1/32000, 1/8000, or 1/4000) and different max (30s or 90s), and additional details (step sizes, bulb modes, x200).
- The criterion states approx. semantics are sufficient.
- Bulb, remote bulb, step sizes are part of the answer but not mentioned in the response at all.
- The response at least gives a shutter speed range overlapping or close to the target.
- For idx_0 and idx_1 target is 1/32000 to 30s; response min is 1/8000, which is four times slower, so not covering the fastest speeds.
- For idx_2 to idx_5 the response min 1/8000 matches the targets, max 90s exceeds 30s.
- For idx_6 and idx_7, response min 1/8000 is faster than target min 1/4000 (so response includes the target range), max 90s > 30s.

Does the difference in min shutter speed matter for approx semantics? Possibly yes, since from 1/32000 to 1/8000 is a big difference, from 1/8000 to 1/4000 less so.

Also, the response omits bulbs and tuning.

Given the grading scale is 0 or 1 and the criterion allows approximate semantics sufficiency, the main determining factor is whether the response points to the same entity i.e. shutter speed range roughly correct.

Bulb and step tuning are supporting details and not required as per criterion.

---

**Final scoring:**

- idx_0: Response misses the extremely fast min shutter speed (1/32000 vs 1/8000), might be considered insufficient approx. semantics → 0
- idx_1: Same as idx_0 → 0
- idx_2: Min matches exactly (1/8000), max longer, supporting details missing but not required → 1
- idx_3: Same as idx_2 → 1
- idx_4: Same as idx_2 →1
- idx_5: Same as idx_4 →1
- idx_6: Response min faster than target min (1/8000 vs 1/4000), response max longer → covers approximate semantics → 1

The response states a much broader range starting from ISO 100 to 320000, which does not match or approximate the target's ISO range.  
  They do not point to the same ISO range. The ranges do not overlap or approximate sufficiently.

  Target is ISO 100-51200. Response says 100-320000 (expandable to 50).  
  The response's native ISO range starts at 100, like the target, but extends much higher (to 320000). The expandable ISO 50 is lower than the target start but close.  
  The response's range encompasses and exceeds the target range, so they refer to roughly the same ISO entity/range, just with expanded capability.

**Common Response Across All Items:**
- Response: ""1/8000secto90sec""

This seems to indicate the shutter speed range from 1/8000 sec to 90 sec.

---

**Target Analysis Per idx:**

- idx_0:
  Target: ""1/32000−30s(stepof1/3,1/2,or1ev;extendableto900sinmmode),bulb,remotebulb""
  The target states a shutter speed starting from 1/32000 (very fast) to 30s, with step increments and extendable to 900s in mm mode, also mentions bulb and remote bulb.
  The response says 1/8000 to 90s, which is different on both minimum and maximum ends and does not mention the steps or bulb.
  Since the response range is narrower (1/8000 vs 1/32000) and longer max (90s vs 30s), but no mention of increments or bulb.
  By criterion, approximate semantics or same entity needed. Since the response mentions a related shutter speed range but not the exact range or detail, it's partially correct but different enough for this grading (0 or 1).
  The target is a more extensive, precise range with details; response omits these details.
  This is a mismatch.

- idx_1:
  Target identical to idx_0, response identical.
  Same judgment applies: mismatch.

- idx_2:
  Target: ""1/8000−30s(fine-tunewith1/3or1/2ev;extendableto900sinmmode),bulb,remotebulb,x200""
  Response: ""1/8000secto90sec""
  Here the response minimum 1/8000 matches target, max 90s > 30s, so max shutter time is longer, missing specific tuning steps, bulb, remote bulb, and x200.
  Semantically related, but missing tuning and bulb related info.
  Given the criterion allows approximate semantics, and the range overlaps partly with the exact start of the range, this might be acceptable, but 90s vs 30s still a discrepancy.
  However, since the semantics (shutter speed range) and mentioned entity converge, maybe acceptable.

- idx_3:
  Same target as idx_2 and same response as idx_2.
  Same judgment: acceptable.

- idx_4:
  Target: ""1/8000−30s(fine-tunewith1/3or1/2ev),bulb,remotebulb,x200""
  Response: same ""1/8000secto90sec""
  Again, min shutter speed matches, max shutter speed is longer in response (90s vs 30s).
  Bulb and remote bulb missing in response, tuning missing.
  Approximate semantics might be accepted depending on strictness.

- idx_5:
  Same as idx_4, same response.
  Same as above.

- idx_6:
  Target: ""1/4000−30s(fine-tunewith1/3or1/2ev),bulb,remotebulb""
  Response: ""1/8000secto90sec""
  Here target minimum is 1/4000, response minimum 1/8000 (faster).
  Target max 30s, response max 90s.
  Response covers wider shutter speed range, but misses tuning and bulb information.
  Approximate range is generally covered, but missing tuning and bulb info.

- idx_7:
  Target: ""1/4000−30s(fine-tunewith1/3ev),bulb,remotebulb""
  Response same, so same analysis as idx_6.

---

**Summary of Judgments:**

- The response always gives shutter speed range as 1/8000 to 90s.
- Targets have different ranges (starting at 1/32000, 1/8000, or 1/4000) and different max (30s or 90s), and additional details (step sizes, bulb modes, x200).
- The criterion states approx. semantics are sufficient.
- Bulb, remote bulb, step sizes are part of the answer but not mentioned in the response at all.
- The response at least gives a shutter speed range overlapping or close to the target.
- For idx_0 and idx_1 target is 1/32000 to 30s; response min is 1/8000, which is four times slower, so not covering the fastest speeds.
- For idx_2 to idx_5 the response min 1/8000 matches the targets, max 90s exceeds 30s.
- For idx_6 and idx_7, response min 1/8000 is faster than target min 1/4000 (so response includes the target range), max 90s > 30s.

Does the difference in min shutter speed matter for approx semantics? Possibly yes, since from 1/32000 to 1/8000 is a big difference, from 1/8000 to 1/4000 less so.

Also, the response omits bulbs and tuning.

Given the grading scale is 0 or 1 and the criterion allows approximate semantics sufficiency, the main determining factor is whether the response points to the same entity i.e. shutter speed range roughly correct.

Bulb and step tuning are supporting details and not required as per criterion.

**Final scoring:**

- idx_0: Response misses the extremely fast min shutter speed (1/32000 vs 1/8000), might be considered insufficient approx. semantics → 0
- idx_1: Same as idx_0 → 0

24mp vs 20.88 million pixels. This is a bigger difference (over 3 mp difference). However, the response is still an approximate figure pointing to megapixels quantity. But they are not the same or approximately the same number. Per criterion, ""approximately the same"" is key.

Is 24 approx equal to 20.88? Percentage difference is (24-20.88)/20.88 ≈ 15%. This is somewhat significant.

Given the criterion allows ""approximately the same,"" and considering typical rounding tolerance, 1.0 mp difference is acceptable, 3+ mp might not be. So this may be scored as 0.

- idx_0:
  Target: ""1/32000−30s(stepof1/3,1/2,or1ev;extendableto900sinmmode),bulb,remotebulb""
  The target states a shutter speed starting from 1/32000 (very fast) to 30s, with step increments and extendable to 900s in mm mode, also mentions bulb and remote bulb.
  The response says 1/8000 to 90s, which is different on both minimum and maximum ends and does not mention the steps or bulb.
  Since the response range is narrower (1/8000 vs 1/32000) and longer max (90s vs 30s), but no mention of increments or bulb.
  By criterion, approximate semantics or same entity needed. Since the response mentions a related shutter speed range but not the exact range or detail, it's partially correct but different enough for this grading (0 or 1).
  The target is a more extensive, precise range with details; response omits these details.
  This is a mismatch.

- idx_1:
  Target identical to idx_0, response identical.
  Same judgment applies: mismatch.

- idx_2:
  Target: ""1/8000−30s(fine-tunewith1/3or1/2ev;extendableto900sinmmode),bulb,remotebulb,x200""
  Response: ""1/8000secto90sec""
  Here the response minimum 1/8000 matches target, max 90s > 30s, so max shutter time is longer, missing specific tuning steps, bulb, remote bulb, and x200.
  Semantically related, but missing tuning and bulb related info.
  Given the criterion allows approximate semantics, and the range overlaps partly with the exact start of the range, this might be acceptable, but 90s vs 30s still a discrepancy.
  However, since the semantics (shutter speed range) and mentioned entity converge, maybe acceptable.

  Bulb and remote bulb missing in response, tuning missing.

  Response covers wider shutter speed range, but misses tuning and bulb information.
  Approximate range is generally covered, but missing tuning and bulb info.

- idx_7:

  Response same, so same analysis as idx_6.

---

**Summary of Judgments:**

- The response always gives shutter speed range as 1/8000 to 90s.
- Targets have different ranges (starting at 1/32000, 1/8000, or 1/4000) and different max (30s or 90s), and additional details (step sizes, bulb modes, x200).
- The criterion states approx. semantics are sufficient.
- Bulb, remote bulb, step sizes are part of the answer but not mentioned in the response at all.
- The response at least gives a shutter speed range overlapping or close to the target.
- For idx_0 and idx_1 target is 1/32000 to 30s; response min is 1/8000, which is four times slower, so not covering the fastest speeds.
- For idx_2 to idx_5 the response min 1/8000 matches the targets, max 90s exceeds 30s.
- For idx_6 and idx_7, response min 1/8000 is faster than target min 1/4000 (so response includes the target range), max 90s > 30s.

Does the difference in min shutter speed matter for approx semantics? Possibly yes, since from 1/32000 to 1/8000 is a big difference, from 1/8000 to 1/4000 less so.

Also, the response omits bulbs and tuning.

Given the grading scale is 0 or 1 and the criterion allows approximate semantics sufficiency, the main determining factor is whether the response points to the same entity i.e. shutter speed range roughly correct.

Bulb and step tuning are supporting details and not required as per criterion.

7. idx_6:  
- response: ""24mp""

24mp vs 20.88 million pixels. This is a bigger difference (over 3 mp difference). However, the response is still an approximate figure pointing to megapixels quantity. But they are not the same or approximately the same number. Per criterion, ""approximately the same"" is key.

Is 24 approx equal to 20.88? Percentage difference is (24-20.88)/20.88 ≈ 15%. This is somewhat significant.

Given the criterion allows ""approximately the same,"" and considering typical rounding tolerance, 1.0 mp difference is acceptable, 3+ mp might not be. So this may be scored as 0.

**Common Response Across All Items:**
- Response: ""1/8000secto90sec""

This seems to indicate the shutter speed range from 1/8000 sec to 90 sec.

---

**Target Analysis Per idx:**

- idx_0:
  Target: ""1/32000−30s(stepof1/3,1/2,or1ev;extendableto900sinmmode),bulb,remotebulb""
  The target states a shutter speed starting from 1/32000 (very fast) to 30s, with step increments and extendable to 900s in mm mode, also mentions bulb and remote bulb.
  The response says 1/8000 to 90s, which is different on both minimum and maximum ends and does not mention the steps or bulb.
  Since the response range is narrower (1/8000 vs 1/32000) and longer max (90s vs 30s), but no mention of increments or bulb.
  By criterion, approximate semantics or same entity needed. Since the response mentions a related shutter speed range but not the exact range or detail, it's partially correct but different enough for this grading (0 or 1).
  The target is a more extensive, precise range with details; response omits these details.
  This is a mismatch.

- idx_1:
  Target identical to idx_0, response identical.
  Same judgment applies: mismatch.

- idx_2:
  Target: ""1/8000−30s(fine-tunewith1/3or1/2ev;extendableto900sinmmode),bulb,remotebulb,x200""
  Response: ""1/8000secto90sec""
  Here the response minimum 1/8000 matches target, max 90s > 30s, so max shutter time is longer, missing specific tuning steps, bulb, remote bulb, and x200.
  Semantically related, but missing tuning and bulb related info.
  Given the criterion allows approximate semantics, and the range overlaps partly with the exact start of the range, this might be acceptable, but 90s vs 30s still a discrepancy.
  However, since the semantics (shutter speed range) and mentioned entity converge, maybe acceptable.

- idx_3:
  Same target as idx_2 and same response as idx_2.
  Same judgment: acceptable.

- idx_4:
  Target: ""1/8000−30s(fine-tunewith1/3or1/2ev),bulb,remotebulb,x200""
  Response: same ""1/8000secto90sec""
  Again, min shutter speed matches, max shutter speed is longer in response (90s vs 30s).
  Bulb and remote bulb missing in response, tuning missing.
  Approximate semantics might be accepted depending on strictness.

- idx_5:
  Same as idx_4, same response.
  Same as above.

- idx_6:
  Target: ""1/4000−30s(fine-tunewith1/3or1/2ev),bulb,remotebulb""
  Response: ""1/8000secto90sec""
  Here target minimum is 1/4000, response minimum 1/8000 (faster).
  Target max 30s, response max 90s.
  Response covers wider shutter speed range, but misses tuning and bulb information.
  Approximate range is generally covered, but missing tuning and bulb info.

- idx_7:
  Target: ""1/4000−30s(fine-tunewith1/3ev),bulb,remotebulb""
  Response same, so same analysis as idx_6.

---

**Summary of Judgments:**

- The response always gives shutter speed range as 1/8000 to 90s.
- Targets have different ranges (starting at 1/32000, 1/8000, or 1/4000) and different max (30s or 90s), and additional details (step sizes, bulb modes, x200).
- The criterion states approx. semantics are sufficient.
- Bulb, remote bulb, step sizes are part of the answer but not mentioned in the response at all.
- The response at least gives a shutter speed range overlapping or close to the target.
- For idx_0 and idx_1 target is 1/32000 to 30s; response min is 1/8000, which is four times slower, so not covering the fastest speeds.
- For idx_2 to idx_5 the response min 1/8000 matches the targets, max 90s exceeds 30s.
- For idx_6 and idx_7, response min 1/8000 is faster than target min 1/4000 (so response includes the target range), max 90s > 30s.

Does the difference in min shutter speed matter for approx semantics? Possibly yes, since from 1/32000 to 1/8000 is a big difference, from 1/8000 to 1/4000 less so.

Also, the response omits bulbs and tuning.

Given the grading scale is 0 or 1 and the criterion allows approximate semantics sufficiency, the main determining factor is whether the response points to the same entity i.e. shutter speed range roughly correct.

Bulb and step tuning are supporting details and not required as per criterion.

---

**Final scoring:**

- idx_0: Response misses the extremely fast min shutter speed (1/32000 vs 1/8000), might be considered insufficient approx. semantics → 0
- idx_1: Same as idx_0 → 0
- idx_2: Min matches exactly (1/8000), max longer, supporting details missing but not required → 1
- idx_3: Same as idx_2 → 1
- idx_4: Same as idx_2 →1
- idx_5: Same as idx_4 →1
- idx_6: Response min faster than target min (1/8000 vs 1/4000), response max longer → covers approximate semantics → 1

Criterion:
- Semantics should be approximately the same or point to the same entity.
- No need for word-for-word correspondence.

---

**Common Response Across All Items:**
- Response: ""1/8000secto90sec""

This seems to indicate the shutter speed range from 1/8000 sec to 90 sec.

---

**Target Analysis Per idx:**

- idx_0:
  Target: ""1/32000−30s(stepof1/3,1/2,or1ev;extendableto900sinmmode),bulb,remotebulb""
  The target states a shutter speed starting from 1/32000 (very fast) to 30s, with step increments and extendable to 900s in mm mode, also mentions bulb and remote bulb.
  The response says 1/8000 to 90s, which is different on both minimum and maximum ends and does not mention the steps or bulb.
  Since the response range is narrower (1/8000 vs 1/32000) and longer max (90s vs 30s), but no mention of increments or bulb.
  By criterion, approximate semantics or same entity needed. Since the response mentions a related shutter speed range but not the exact range or detail, it's partially correct but different enough for this grading (0 or 1).
  The target is a more extensive, precise range with details; response omits these details.
  This is a mismatch.

- idx_1:
  Target identical to idx_0, response identical.
  Same judgment applies: mismatch.

- idx_2:
  Target: ""1/8000−30s(fine-tunewith1/3or1/2ev;extendableto900sinmmode),bulb,remotebulb,x200""
  Response: ""1/8000secto90sec""
  Here the response minimum 1/8000 matches target, max 90s > 30s, so max shutter time is longer, missing specific tuning steps, bulb, remote bulb, and x200.
  Semantically related, but missing tuning and bulb related info.
  Given the criterion allows approximate semantics, and the range overlaps partly with the exact start of the range, this might be acceptable, but 90s vs 30s still a discrepancy.
  However, since the semantics (shutter speed range) and mentioned entity converge, maybe acceptable.

- idx_3:
  Same target as idx_2 and same response as idx_2.
  Same judgment: acceptable.

- idx_4:
  Target: ""1/8000−30s(fine-tunewith1/3or1/2ev),bulb,remotebulb,x200""
  Response: same ""1/8000secto90sec""
  Again, min shutter speed matches, max shutter speed is longer in response (90s vs 30s).
  Bulb and remote bulb missing in response, tuning missing.
  Approximate semantics might be accepted depending on strictness.

- idx_5:
  Same as idx_4, same response.
  Same as above.

- idx_6:
  Target: ""1/4000−30s(fine-tunewith1/3or1/2ev),bulb,remotebulb""
  Response: ""1/8000secto90sec""
  Here target minimum is 1/4000, response minimum 1/8000 (faster).
  Target max 30s, response max 90s.
  Response covers wider shutter speed range, but misses tuning and bulb information.
  Approximate range is generally covered, but missing tuning and bulb info.

- idx_7:
  Target: ""1/4000−30s(fine-tunewith1/3ev),bulb,remotebulb""
  Response same, so same analysis as idx_6.

---

**Summary of Judgments:**

- The response always gives shutter speed range as 1/8000 to 90s.
- Targets have different ranges (starting at 1/32000, 1/8000, or 1/4000) and different max (30s or 90s), and additional details (step sizes, bulb modes, x200).
- The criterion states approx. semantics are sufficient.
- Bulb, remote bulb, step sizes are part of the answer but not mentioned in the response at all.
- The response at least gives a shutter speed range overlapping or close to the target.
- For idx_0 and idx_1 target is 1/32000 to 30s; response min is 1/8000, which is four times slower, so not covering the fastest speeds.
- For idx_2 to idx_5 the response min 1/8000 matches the targets, max 90s exceeds 30s.
- For idx_6 and idx_7, response min 1/8000 is faster than target min 1/4000 (so response includes the target range), max 90s > 30s.

Does the difference in min shutter speed matter for approx semantics? Possibly yes, since from 1/32000 to 1/8000 is a big difference, from 1/8000 to 1/4000 less so.

Also, the response omits bulbs and tuning.

Given the grading scale is 0 or 1 and the criterion allows approximate semantics sufficiency, the main determining factor is whether the response points to the same entity i.e. shutter speed range roughly correct.

Bulb and step tuning are supporting details and not required as per criterion.

---

**Final scoring:**

- idx_0: Response misses the extremely fast min shutter speed (1/32000 vs 1/8000), might be considered insufficient approx. semantics → 0
- idx_1: Same as idx_0 → 0
- idx_2: Min matches exactly (1/8000), max longer, supporting details missing but not required → 1
- idx_3: Same as idx_2 → 1
- idx_4: Same as idx_2 →1
- idx_5: Same as idx_4 →1
- idx_6: Response min faster than target min (1/8000 vs 1/4000), response max longer → covers approximate semantics → 1
- idx_7: Same as idx_6 →1
