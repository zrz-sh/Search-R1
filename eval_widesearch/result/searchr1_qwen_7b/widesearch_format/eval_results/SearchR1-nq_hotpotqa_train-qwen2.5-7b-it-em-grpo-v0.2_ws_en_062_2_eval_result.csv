Criterion summary: The response is correct if the semantics approximate the reference answer or point to the same entity. No need for word-for-word match.

**idx_0:**  
- Response: ""council""  
- Target: ""universitycouncil""  
Analysis: ""council"" is a shorter form but the same entity as ""universitycouncil"". According to the criterion, approximate semantics pointing to the same entity suffice.  
Score: 1

---

**idx_1:**  
- Response: ""regenthouse,universitycouncil""  
- Target: ""theregenthouse""  
Analysis: The response answers ""regenthouse"" which matches ""theregenthouse"". The extra entity ""universitycouncil"" is not penalized as per the criterion (no mention of penalties for extra responses). The main entity is present.  
Score: 1

**idx_2:**  
- Response: ""council""  
- Target: ""theuniversitycourt""  
Analysis: ""council"" and ""universitycourt"" are different entities, not semantically the same. ""Council"" is generic or points to ""university council"" but target is ""university court"". Different entities.
