### idx_0
- response: ""32k""  
- target: ""1m""  
**Analysis:** 32k and 1m refer to different quantities (32,000 vs. 1,000,000). They clearly do not match or indicate the same entity.  
**Score:** 0

### idx_1
- response: ""16k""  
- target: ""1m""  
**Analysis:** 16k vs 1m are different quantities, no semantic match or equivalence.  
**Score:** 0

### idx_2
- response: ""16k""  
- target: ""200k""  
**Analysis:** 16k and 200k are different numbers, so different entities. Not matching.  
**Score:** 0

### idx_3
- response: ""32k""  
- target: ""200k""  
**Analysis:** Different numbers, no semantic equivalence.  
**Score:** 0

### idx_4
- response: ""16k""  
- target: ""200k""  
**Analysis:** Different quantities, no equivalence.  
**Score:** 0

### idx_5
- response: ""32k""  
- target: ""200k""  
**Analysis:** Different quantities, no equivalence.  
**Score:** 0

### idx_6
- response: ""32k""  
- target: ""32k""  
**Analysis:** Exactly the same entity. Perfect match.  
**Score:** 1

### idx_7
- response: ""32k""  
- target: ""256k""  
**Analysis:** Different quantities, no equivalence.  
**Score:** 0

Analysis:

- idx_0: response = ""anthropic"", target = ""谷歌""  
  ""Anthropic"" and ""谷歌"" (Google) are clearly distinct entities. Not the same or equivalent.  
  Score: 0

- idx_1: same as idx_0  
  Score: 0

- idx_2: response = ""openai"", target = ""openai""  
  Fully matched.  
  Score: 1
