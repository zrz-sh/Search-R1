Criterion states:  
- Semantics are approximately the same or point to the same entity.  
- Word-for-word correspondence is not necessary.

---

**Item idx_0:**  
- Response: ""ygentertainment""  
- Target: ""yg""  

Analysis:  
- ""yg"" is commonly known as ""YG Entertainment,"" a South Korean company.  
- The response ""ygentertainment"" fully includes ""yg"" as its root and expands it to the full entity name.  
- Semantically, they point to the same entity.  
- Hence, they meet the criterion of approximate semantic equivalence or same entity.  

Score: 1

**Item idx_1:**  
- Response: ""ygentertainment""  
- Target: ""yg""  

Same as idx_0, the analysis follows.

Criterion: It is sufficient if the semantics are approximately the same as the reference answer or if they point to the same entity. No need for word-for-word correspondence.

Target: ""blackpink""  
Analysis: Both are exactly the same. So, clearly correct.

**idx_0**:  
- Target: ""whistle（휘파람）\nboombayah（붐바야）""  
- Response: ""whistle,boombayah""  

Analysis:  
- Response contains both ""whistle"" and ""boombayah"", which are the main titles in the target.  
- The response separates them by a comma, but this doesn't affect semantic equivalence.  
- Additional info like the Korean titles or parentheses is not required according to the criteria.  
- Hence, the response sufficiently captures the target semantics.

Score for idx_0 = 1

**idx_1**:  
- Target: ""playingwithfire（불장난）\nstay\nwhistle（acousticver.）""  
- Response: ""unknown""  

Analysis:  
- The target contains 3 song titles: ""playingwithfire"", ""stay"", and ""whistle (acoustic ver.)"".  
- The response ""unknown"" does not correspond to any of these titles or the same semantics.  
- According to the criterion, the semantics should be approximately the same or point to the same entity; ""unknown"" does not fulfill that.  
- Score should be 0.
