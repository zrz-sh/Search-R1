- Target answer:  
  - introductiontomediaandcommunicationstheory  
  - 30credits  
  - dissertation  
  - 60credits  
- Response: `'researchmethodology,dissertation'`  
- Analysis:  
  - The response lists ""researchmethodology"" and ""dissertation"".  
  - The target answer has ""introductiontomediaandcommunicationstheory"" and ""dissertation"".  
  - ""dissertation"" appears in both, which matches the target entity.  
  - ""researchmethodology"" != ""introduction to media and communications theory"" but these are different entities.  
  - The criterion says semantics should be approximately the same or pointing to the same entity. Here, the response misses ""introduction to media and communication theory"" and instead has ""researchmethodology"" which is different.  
- Since 'dissertation' is matched, partial overlap exists. But since the scoring is either 0 or 1 and no mention of partial credit is given, is this acceptable?  
- Criterion states it is sufficient if semantics approximately the same or points to same entity. Here for one of the two components (dissertation), it matches exactly but the other one is off.  
- No tolerance for partial, so either the entire answer or definitely semantically pointing to same entities. In this case, one item is completely wrong (""researchmethodology"" is not ""introductiontomediaandcommunicationstheory"").  
- However, the criterion states it is sufficient if the semantics are approximately the same or point to the same entity. Since there is only some correspondence (dissertation), and missing or different on the other part.  
- There is no explicit statement about partial credit. The instruction says: score can only be 0 or 1. So this is either correct or wrong.  
- The response partially captures one element but not the other. Since the second element is completely different and one component is missing, this is not sufficient to say the response semantics approximately cover the target answer as a whole.  
- Therefore, the score is 0.

### idx_0

- **Target:** ""6.5witha6.5inwritingandnoelementlowerthan6.0""  
- **Response:** ""/""  
- **Analysis:**  
  The target answer gives specific info with score ""6.5"" with a 6.5 in writing and no element lower than 6.0.  
  The response is just ""/"", which does not convey any semantic match or pointer to the answer. This is effectively a ""no answer"" or an irrelevant character, so it does NOT suffice.  
- **Score:** 0

---

### idx_1

- **Target:** ""6.5witha6.5inwritingandnoelementlowerthan6.0""  
- **Response:** ""6.5witha6.5inwriting""  
- **Analysis:**  
  The response includes ""6.5"" and ""6.5 in writing"" part, which is a partial but important part of the target. It states the core score and the writing subscore.  
  However, the response is missing ""and no element lower than 6.0"" which adds a condition or a further specification.  

  The criterion states that semantic similarity or pointing to the same entity is sufficient. The response points to a core entity: the IELTS overall and writing score, but misses the stricter condition on individual element scores. They are closely related but not fully comprehensive.

  This can be debated, but generally, partial information that misses key qualifying detail is usually scored 0 in such strict integer scoring unless the criterion explicitly allows partial.

  The criterion is somewhat lenient on semantic equivalence or pointing to the same entity, so this response recognizes the score and the writing score - these can be considered the main elements.

- **Score:** 1 (Because the response points to the same entity: a 6.5 overall with a writing score; the ""no element lower than 6.0"" is additional detail, but not altering the main semantic equivalence.)
