Criterion:
- Semantics must be approximately the same or point to the same entity.
- No need for exact wording, just the same referent.

### idx_0
- Response: ""marinelepen""
- Target: ""marinelepen""
- They are identical, so this is a full match.
- Score: 1

### idx_1
- Response: ""fraukepetry""
- Target: ""berndlucke""
- Different entities. No semantic equivalence or pointing to the same entity.
- Score: 0

### idx_2
- Response: ""nan""
- Target: ""alexandergauland&\naliceweidel""
- Response is ""nan"" which likely means ""not a name"" or empty.
- Target is two entities: ""alexandergauland"" and ""aliceweidel"".
- No matching entity or semantic equivalence.
- Score: 0

### idx_3
- Response: ""nan""
- Target: ""jörgmeuthen&tinochrupalla""

- No matching or semantic equivalence.

Analysis:
- ""nan"" is not a correct answer. It does not represent anything semantically related to ""larépubliqueenmarche!""
- Therefore, score = 0

Analysis:
- Response ""nan"" is meaningless here, no semantic relevance to ""christiandemocraticunion""
- Therefore, score = 0

Analysis:
- Same as idx_1, wrong answer
