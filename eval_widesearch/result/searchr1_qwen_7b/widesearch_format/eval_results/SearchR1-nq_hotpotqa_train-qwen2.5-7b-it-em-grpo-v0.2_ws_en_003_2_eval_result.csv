### Analysis:

- **idx_0**:  
  - Response: ""olympic""  
  - Target: ""olympics""  
  - Criterion: It is sufficient if the semantics are approximately the same or refer to the same entity.  
  - ""olympic"" (adjective or singular form) and ""olympics"" (plural noun referring to the event) are clearly referring to the same entity (the Olympic Games). The semantic meaning is essentially the same.  
  - Therefore, score: 1.

- **idx_1**:  
  - Response: ""olympic""  
  - Target: ""olympics""  
  - Same as idx_0, the response references the same entity, semantics match.  
  - Therefore, score: 1.

- **idx_2**:  
  - Response: ""olympic""  
  - Target: ""olympics""  
  - Same reasoning as above.

Analysis:

### idx_0

- **Response:** ""eileengu,chloekim""  
- **Target:**  
  - gueileen  
  - ledeuxtess

**Analysis:**  
The response mentions ""eileengu"" and ""chloekim"" which do not appear in the target list of names: ""gueileen"", ""ledeuxtess"", ""gremaudmathilde"".  
- ""eileengu"" vs ""gueileen"" might look similar but the letter order and composition is quite distinct; no clear link.  
- ""chloekim"" is nowhere near the target names.  
Since the response names do not point to the same entities or approximate semantics, the answer is incorrect.

**Analysis:**  
Again, the response names don't match or approximate the target names.  
- ""eileengu"" does not correspond to ""gueileen"", ""cassiesharpe"", or ""rachaelkarker"" semantically or as entities.  
- ""chloekim"" is again unrelated to any of the target names.  
Therefore, the response is incorrect.
