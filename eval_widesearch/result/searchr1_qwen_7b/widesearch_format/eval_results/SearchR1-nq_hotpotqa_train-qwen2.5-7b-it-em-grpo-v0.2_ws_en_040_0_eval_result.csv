Criterion:
- It is sufficient if the semantics are approximately the same as the reference answer or if they point to the same entity.
- No need for word-for-word correspondence.
- The entities here are countries: ""china"" vs ""china"" and ""us"" vs ""usa""; ""us"" and ""usa"" are considered the same entity (United States).

- ""us"" matches ""usa"" as per criterion (point to same entity).

Criterion:
- It is sufficient if the semantics are approximately the same as the reference answer or if they point to the same entity.
- No need for word-for-word correspondence.
- The entities here are countries: ""china"" vs ""china"" and ""us"" vs ""usa""; ""us"" and ""usa"" are considered the same entity (United States).

- ""us"" matches ""usa"" as per criterion (point to same entity).

Criterion:

- Different entities.  
- Score: 0

**idx_12**  
Response: ""social""  
Target: ""photo&video""

",photo&video,social,0.0,"Let's analyze each pair according to the criterion:

Criterion:
- It is sufficient if the semantics are approximately the same as the reference answer or if they point to the same entity.
- No need for word-for-word correspondence.
- The entities here are countries: ""china"" vs ""china"" and ""us"" vs ""usa""; ""us"" and ""usa"" are considered the same entity (United States).
- So ""china"" matches ""china"" exactly.
- ""us"" matches ""usa"" as per criterion (point to same entity).
- If response and target indicate different entities (e.g., ""china"" vs ""usa""), then score 0.

Analysis per idx:

- idx_0: response = ""china"", target = ""china"" → same entity → score 1
- idx_1: response = ""us"", target = ""usa"" → ""us"" and ""usa"" same entity → score 1
- idx_2: response = ""us"", target = ""usa"" → score 1
- idx_3: response = ""china"", target = ""usa"" → different entities → score 0
- idx_4: response = ""china"", target = ""usa"" → different entities → score 0
- idx_5: response = ""china"", target = ""china"" → same entity → score 1
- idx_6: response = ""us"", target = ""usa"" → same entity → score 1
- idx_7: response = ""china"", target = ""usa"" → different entities → score 0
- idx_8: response = ""us"", target = ""usa"" → same entity → score 1
- idx_9: response = ""china"", target = ""china"" → same entity → score 1
- idx_10: response = ""us"", target = ""usa"" → same entity → score 1
- idx_11: response = ""china"", target = ""usa"" → different entities → score 0

Criterion:  
- Semantics approximate or same entity is sufficient.  
- No need for exact wording, but should refer to the same entity.
