### Given:

- Each response is `'-'`
- The target answers are various people names, mainly `""michaelphelps""`, with a few others like `""chadleclos""`, `""paulbiedermann""`, and `""ryanlochte""`.
- Grading Criterion: It is sufficient if the semantics approximately match or point to the same entity. No need for exact textual correspondence.

### Analysis:

- Response is `'-'` for all indices.
- The response `'-'` does not correspond semantically to any of the names `""michaelphelps""`, `""chadleclos""`, `""paulbiedermann""`, or `""ryanlochte""`.
- Since `'-'` is not a meaningful answer and does not attempt to indicate any of the target answers, it does not meet the criterion of ""approximate semantic sameness"" or pointing to the same entity.

### Given:

- Each response is `'-'`
- The target answers are various people names, mainly `""michaelphelps""`, with a few others like `""chadleclos""`, `""paulbiedermann""`, and `""ryanlochte""`.
- Grading Criterion: It is sufficient if the semantics approximately match or point to the same entity. No need for exact textual correspondence.

### Analysis:

- Response is `'-'` for all indices.
- The response `'-'` does not correspond semantically to any of the names `""michaelphelps""`, `""chadleclos""`, `""paulbiedermann""`, or `""ryanlochte""`.
- Since `'-'` is not a meaningful answer and does not attempt to indicate any of the target answers, it does not meet the criterion of ""approximate semantic sameness"" or pointing to the same entity.
- Therefore, each pair should be scored as 0.

### Given:

- Each response is `'-'`
- The target answers are various people names, mainly `""michaelphelps""`, with a few others like `""chadleclos""`, `""paulbiedermann""`, and `""ryanlochte""`.
- Grading Criterion: It is sufficient if the semantics approximately match or point to the same entity. No need for exact textual correspondence.

### Analysis:

- Response is `'-'` for all indices.
- The response `'-'` does not correspond semantically to any of the names `""michaelphelps""`, `""chadleclos""`, `""paulbiedermann""`, or `""ryanlochte""`.
- Since `'-'` is not a meaningful answer and does not attempt to indicate any of the target answers, it does not meet the criterion of ""approximate semantic sameness"" or pointing to the same entity.
- Therefore, each pair should be scored as 0.

### Given:

- Each response is `'-'`
- The target answers are various people names, mainly `""michaelphelps""`, with a few others like `""chadleclos""`, `""paulbiedermann""`, and `""ryanlochte""`.
- Grading Criterion: It is sufficient if the semantics approximately match or point to the same entity. No need for exact textual correspondence.

### Analysis:

- Response is `'-'` for all indices.
- The response `'-'` does not correspond semantically to any of the names `""michaelphelps""`, `""chadleclos""`, `""paulbiedermann""`, or `""ryanlochte""`.
- Since `'-'` is not a meaningful answer and does not attempt to indicate any of the target answers, it does not meet the criterion of ""approximate semantic sameness"" or pointing to the same entity.
- Therefore, each pair should be scored as 0.

### Given:

- Each response is `'-'`
- The target answers are various people names, mainly `""michaelphelps""`, with a few others like `""chadleclos""`, `""paulbiedermann""`, and `""ryanlochte""`.
- Grading Criterion: It is sufficient if the semantics approximately match or point to the same entity. No need for exact textual correspondence.

### Analysis:

- Response is `'-'` for all indices.
- The response `'-'` does not correspond semantically to any of the names `""michaelphelps""`, `""chadleclos""`, `""paulbiedermann""`, or `""ryanlochte""`.
- Since `'-'` is not a meaningful answer and does not attempt to indicate any of the target answers, it does not meet the criterion of ""approximate semantic sameness"" or pointing to the same entity.
- Therefore, each pair should be scored as 0.

### Given:

- Each response is `'-'`
- The target answers are various people names, mainly `""michaelphelps""`, with a few others like `""chadleclos""`, `""paulbiedermann""`, and `""ryanlochte""`.
- Grading Criterion: It is sufficient if the semantics approximately match or point to the same entity. No need for exact textual correspondence.

### Analysis:

- Response is `'-'` for all indices.
- The response `'-'` does not correspond semantically to any of the names `""michaelphelps""`, `""chadleclos""`, `""paulbiedermann""`, or `""ryanlochte""`.
- Since `'-'` is not a meaningful answer and does not attempt to indicate any of the target answers, it does not meet the criterion of ""approximate semantic sameness"" or pointing to the same entity.
- Therefore, each pair should be scored as 0.

### Given:

- Each response is `'-'`
- The target answers are various people names, mainly `""michaelphelps""`, with a few others like `""chadleclos""`, `""paulbiedermann""`, and `""ryanlochte""`.
- Grading Criterion: It is sufficient if the semantics approximately match or point to the same entity. No need for exact textual correspondence.

### Analysis:

- Response is `'-'` for all indices.
- The response `'-'` does not correspond semantically to any of the names `""michaelphelps""`, `""chadleclos""`, `""paulbiedermann""`, or `""ryanlochte""`.
- Since `'-'` is not a meaningful answer and does not attempt to indicate any of the target answers, it does not meet the criterion of ""approximate semantic sameness"" or pointing to the same entity.

### Given:

- Each response is `'-'`
- The target answers are various people names, mainly `""michaelphelps""`, with a few others like `""chadleclos""`, `""paulbiedermann""`, and `""ryanlochte""`.
- Grading Criterion: It is sufficient if the semantics approximately match or point to the same entity. No need for exact textual correspondence.

### Analysis:

- Response is `'-'` for all indices.
- The response `'-'` does not correspond semantically to any of the names `""michaelphelps""`, `""chadleclos""`, `""paulbiedermann""`, or `""ryanlochte""`.
- Since `'-'` is not a meaningful answer and does not attempt to indicate any of the target answers, it does not meet the criterion of ""approximate semantic sameness"" or pointing to the same entity.

### Given:

- Each response is `'-'`
- The target answers are various people names, mainly `""michaelphelps""`, with a few others like `""chadleclos""`, `""paulbiedermann""`, and `""ryanlochte""`.
- Grading Criterion: It is sufficient if the semantics approximately match or point to the same entity. No need for exact textual correspondence.

### Analysis:

- Response is `'-'` for all indices.
- The response `'-'` does not correspond semantically to any of the names `""michaelphelps""`, `""chadleclos""`, `""paulbiedermann""`, or `""ryanlochte""`.
- Since `'-'` is not a meaningful answer and does not attempt to indicate any of the target answers, it does not meet the criterion of ""approximate semantic sameness"" or pointing to the same entity.
- Therefore, each pair should be scored as 0.

### Given:

- Each response is `'-'`
- The target answers are various people names, mainly `""michaelphelps""`, with a few others like `""chadleclos""`, `""paulbiedermann""`, and `""ryanlochte""`.
- Grading Criterion: It is sufficient if the semantics approximately match or point to the same entity. No need for exact textual correspondence.

### Analysis:

- Response is `'-'` for all indices.
- The response `'-'` does not correspond semantically to any of the names `""michaelphelps""`, `""chadleclos""`, `""paulbiedermann""`, or `""ryanlochte""`.
- Since `'-'` is not a meaningful answer and does not attempt to indicate any of the target answers, it does not meet the criterion of ""approximate semantic sameness"" or pointing to the same entity.
- Therefore, each pair should be scored as 0.

### Given:

- Each response is `'-'`
- The target answers are various people names, mainly `""michaelphelps""`, with a few others like `""chadleclos""`, `""paulbiedermann""`, and `""ryanlochte""`.
- Grading Criterion: It is sufficient if the semantics approximately match or point to the same entity. No need for exact textual correspondence.

### Analysis:

- Response is `'-'` for all indices.
- The response `'-'` does not correspond semantically to any of the names `""michaelphelps""`, `""chadleclos""`, `""paulbiedermann""`, or `""ryanlochte""`.
- Since `'-'` is not a meaningful answer and does not attempt to indicate any of the target answers, it does not meet the criterion of ""approximate semantic sameness"" or pointing to the same entity.
- Therefore, each pair should be scored as 0.

### Given:

- Each response is `'-'`
- The target answers are various people names, mainly `""michaelphelps""`, with a few others like `""chadleclos""`, `""paulbiedermann""`, and `""ryanlochte""`.
- Grading Criterion: It is sufficient if the semantics approximately match or point to the same entity. No need for exact textual correspondence.

### Analysis:

- Response is `'-'` for all indices.
- The response `'-'` does not correspond semantically to any of the names `""michaelphelps""`, `""chadleclos""`, `""paulbiedermann""`, or `""ryanlochte""`.
- Since `'-'` is not a meaningful answer and does not attempt to indicate any of the target answers, it does not meet the criterion of ""approximate semantic sameness"" or pointing to the same entity.
- Therefore, each pair should be scored as 0.

### Given:

- Each response is `'-'`
- The target answers are various people names, mainly `""michaelphelps""`, with a few others like `""chadleclos""`, `""paulbiedermann""`, and `""ryanlochte""`.
- Grading Criterion: It is sufficient if the semantics approximately match or point to the same entity. No need for exact textual correspondence.

### Analysis:

- Response is `'-'` for all indices.
- The response `'-'` does not correspond semantically to any of the names `""michaelphelps""`, `""chadleclos""`, `""paulbiedermann""`, or `""ryanlochte""`.
- Since `'-'` is not a meaningful answer and does not attempt to indicate any of the target answers, it does not meet the criterion of ""approximate semantic sameness"" or pointing to the same entity.

Given that, the response should be considered correct only if it matches or refers to the same event.

Check one by one:

idx_0: response = 2004summerolympics, target = athensolympicgames

- 2004 Summer Olympics were held in Athens, so these point to the same event.

=> score 1

idx_1: response = 2000summerolympics, target = athensolympicgames

- 2000 Summer Olympics were in Sydney, different from Athens.

=> score 0

idx_2: same as idx_0, same response and target

=> score 1

idx_3: response = 2008summerolympics, target = 2008beijingsummerolympics

- Both are the 2008 Beijing Olympics, clearly same event.

### Given:

- Each response is `'-'`
- The target answers are various people names, mainly `""michaelphelps""`, with a few others like `""chadleclos""`, `""paulbiedermann""`, and `""ryanlochte""`.
- Grading Criterion: It is sufficient if the semantics approximately match or point to the same entity. No need for exact textual correspondence.

### Analysis:

- Response is `'-'` for all indices.
- The response `'-'` does not correspond semantically to any of the names `""michaelphelps""`, `""chadleclos""`, `""paulbiedermann""`, or `""ryanlochte""`.
- Since `'-'` is not a meaningful answer and does not attempt to indicate any of the target answers, it does not meet the criterion of ""approximate semantic sameness"" or pointing to the same entity.

- Each response is `'-'`
- The target answers are various people names, mainly `""michaelphelps""`, with a few others like `""chadleclos""`, `""paulbiedermann""`, and `""ryanlochte""`.
- Grading Criterion: It is sufficient if the semantics approximately match or point to the same entity. No need for exact textual correspondence.

### Analysis:

- Response is `'-'` for all indices.
- The response `'-'` does not correspond semantically to any of the names `""michaelphelps""`, `""chadleclos""`, `""paulbiedermann""`, or `""ryanlochte""`.
- Since `'-'` is not a meaningful answer and does not attempt to indicate any of the target answers, it does not meet the criterion of ""approximate semantic sameness"" or pointing to the same entity.

### Given:

- Each response is `'-'`
- The target answers are various people names, mainly `""michaelphelps""`, with a few others like `""chadleclos""`, `""paulbiedermann""`, and `""ryanlochte""`.
- Grading Criterion: It is sufficient if the semantics approximately match or point to the same entity. No need for exact textual correspondence.

### Analysis:

- Response is `'-'` for all indices.
- The response `'-'` does not correspond semantically to any of the names `""michaelphelps""`, `""chadleclos""`, `""paulbiedermann""`, or `""ryanlochte""`.
- Since `'-'` is not a meaningful answer and does not attempt to indicate any of the target answers, it does not meet the criterion of ""approximate semantic sameness"" or pointing to the same entity.
- Therefore, each pair should be scored as 0.

### Given:

- Each response is `'-'`
- The target answers are various people names, mainly `""michaelphelps""`, with a few others like `""chadleclos""`, `""paulbiedermann""`, and `""ryanlochte""`.
- Grading Criterion: It is sufficient if the semantics approximately match or point to the same entity. No need for exact textual correspondence.

### Analysis:

- Response is `'-'` for all indices.
- The response `'-'` does not correspond semantically to any of the names `""michaelphelps""`, `""chadleclos""`, `""paulbiedermann""`, or `""ryanlochte""`.
- Since `'-'` is not a meaningful answer and does not attempt to indicate any of the target answers, it does not meet the criterion of ""approximate semantic sameness"" or pointing to the same entity.
- Therefore, each pair should be scored as 0.

### Given:

- Each response is `'-'`
- The target answers are various people names, mainly `""michaelphelps""`, with a few others like `""chadleclos""`, `""paulbiedermann""`, and `""ryanlochte""`.
- Grading Criterion: It is sufficient if the semantics approximately match or point to the same entity. No need for exact textual correspondence.

### Analysis:

- Response is `'-'` for all indices.
- The response `'-'` does not correspond semantically to any of the names `""michaelphelps""`, `""chadleclos""`, `""paulbiedermann""`, or `""ryanlochte""`.
- Since `'-'` is not a meaningful answer and does not attempt to indicate any of the target answers, it does not meet the criterion of ""approximate semantic sameness"" or pointing to the same entity.
- Therefore, each pair should be scored as 0.

### Given:

- Each response is `'-'`
- The target answers are various people names, mainly `""michaelphelps""`, with a few others like `""chadleclos""`, `""paulbiedermann""`, and `""ryanlochte""`.
- Grading Criterion: It is sufficient if the semantics approximately match or point to the same entity. No need for exact textual correspondence.

### Analysis:

- Response is `'-'` for all indices.
- The response `'-'` does not correspond semantically to any of the names `""michaelphelps""`, `""chadleclos""`, `""paulbiedermann""`, or `""ryanlochte""`.
- Since `'-'` is not a meaningful answer and does not attempt to indicate any of the target answers, it does not meet the criterion of ""approximate semantic sameness"" or pointing to the same entity.
- Therefore, each pair should be scored as 0.

- Each response is `'-'`
- The target answers are various people names, mainly `""michaelphelps""`, with a few others like `""chadleclos""`, `""paulbiedermann""`, and `""ryanlochte""`.
- Grading Criterion: It is sufficient if the semantics approximately match or point to the same entity. No need for exact textual correspondence.

### Analysis:

- Response is `'-'` for all indices.
- The response `'-'` does not correspond semantically to any of the names `""michaelphelps""`, `""chadleclos""`, `""paulbiedermann""`, or `""ryanlochte""`.
- Since `'-'` is not a meaningful answer and does not attempt to indicate any of the target answers, it does not meet the criterion of ""approximate semantic sameness"" or pointing to the same entity.

Criterion: ""It is sufficient if the semantics are approximately the same as the reference answer or if they point to the same entity.""

The entities here are specific events:

- athensolympicgames = 2004 Summer Olympics (held in Athens)
- 2008beijingsummerolympics = 2008 Summer Olympics (Beijing)
- 2012londonsummerolympics = 2012 Summer Olympics (London)
- olympicgamesrio2016 = 2016 Summer Olympics (Rio)
- worldaquaticschampionships = a different event, World Aquatics Championships, which is not an Olympic Summer Games

Given that, the response should be considered correct only if it matches or refers to the same event.

Check one by one:

idx_0: response = 2004summerolympics, target = athensolympicgames

- 2004 Summer Olympics were held in Athens, so these point to the same event.

=> score 1

idx_1: response = 2000summerolympics, target = athensolympicgames

- 2000 Summer Olympics were in Sydney, different from Athens.

=> score 0

idx_2: same as idx_0, same response and target

=> score 1

idx_3: response = 2008summerolympics, target = 2008beijingsummerolympics

- Both are the 2008 Beijing Olympics, clearly same event.

=> score 1

idx_4: response = 2000summerolympics, target = 2008beijingsummerolympics

- Different years/events

=> 0

idx_5: response = 2004summerolympics, target = 2008beijingsummerolympics

- Different years/events

=> 0

idx_6: response = 2008summerolympics, target = 2008beijingsummerolympics

- Same as idx_3

=> 1

idx_7: response = 2008summerolympics, target=2012londonsummerolympics

- Different year/events

=> 0

idx_8: response = 2012summerolympics, target=2012londonsummerolympics

```",worldaquaticschampionships,2004summerolympics,0.0,"The responses for all idx entries are ""-"" (a dash), which implies no valid or meaningful answer was given. The targets are various swimmer names.

The grading criterion states:
- It is sufficient if the semantics are approximately the same as the reference answer or if they point to the same entity.
- No need for word-for-word correspondence, but the response must have some semantic relationship or point to the target.

Analysis per idx:
- All responses are ""-"", which does not correlate or refer to the target names in any way.
- Therefore, none of the responses fulfill the criterion of ""semantics are approximately the same"" or pointing to the same entity.

Hence, all responses should receive a score of 0.
