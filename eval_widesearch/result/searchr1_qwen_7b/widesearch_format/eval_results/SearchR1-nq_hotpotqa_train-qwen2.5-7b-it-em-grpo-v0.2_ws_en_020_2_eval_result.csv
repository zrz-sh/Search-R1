---

**idx_0:**  
Response: ""newfoundlandandlabrador""  
Target: ""newfoundland,newfoundlandandlabrador""  
Analysis: The response matches one of the two target locations exactly. The reference target includes “newfoundland” (a smaller region or part) and the larger Newfoundland and Labrador. Since the response includes the larger entity (province), it corresponds closely. This counts as correct.  
Score: 1

**idx_1:**  
Response: ""alberta""  
Target: ""fortmacleod,alberta""  
Analysis: Target specifies a city (Fort Macleod) in Alberta. Response only mentions the province. The criterion states: for a specific location, main city/county is acceptable, province alone is not enough. The target has a city+province, the response only has the province. So response misses the city detail. Not correct.  
Score: 0

**idx_2:**  
Response: ""northwestterritories""  
Target: ""albertaandnorthwestterritories,canada""  
Analysis: Target has two regions: Alberta and Northwest Territories, both in Canada. Response mentions only one of these two regions. The criterion requires all multiple addresses to correspond. Missing Alberta.  
Score: 0

**idx_3:**  
Response: ""alberta,britishcolumbia""  
Target: ""albertaandbritishcolumbia""  
Analysis: Both contain Alberta and British Columbia. Semantics correspond fully.  
Score: 1

**idx_4:**  
Response: ""québeccity""  
Target: ""cityofquebec""  
Analysis: Same city name (Québec City). Corresponds perfectly.  
Score: 1

**idx_5:**  
Response: ""alberta,montana""  
Target: ""provinceofalberta,canada;stateofmontana,usa""  
Analysis: Response has Alberta and Montana, matching the two places in the target. Semantics match.  
Score: 1

**idx_6:**  
Response: ""stateofmexico""  
Target: ""mexicocity""  
Analysis: Mexico City is a city, ""State of Mexico"" is a separate federal entity/state surrounding Mexico City but different. The criterion says semantics must approximately correspond or point to the same entity. These are two different entities. Not correct.  
Score: 0

**idx_7:**  
Response: ""stateofmexico""  
Target: ""teotihuacán,stateofmexico,mexico""  
Analysis: Target includes Teotihuacán (a specific site), state of Mexico (entity), Mexico (country). Response only has the state of Mexico. Missing Teotihuacán and Mexico explicitly. However, since the main location is state of Mexico and it's included in both, partial. But the target is multiple locations: Teotihuacán and state of Mexico and Mexico (country). Multiple addresses require all correspond. Response is missing the first, Teotihuacán.  
Score: 0

**idx_8:**  
Response: ""veracruz""  
Target: ""veracruz,mexico""  
Analysis: Matching location Veracruz; country info missing in response but not required if main city/county is given. Corresponds sufficiently.  
Score: 1

**idx_9:**

Target: ""michoacán,mexico""  
Analysis: Same as above, region corresponds. Country omitted but ok. Corresponds.  
Score: 1

**idx_10:**  
Response: ""colorado""  
Target: ""montezumacounty,colorado,""  
Analysis: Target is a county in Colorado. Response only gives the state (Colorado). Province/state alone not enough if target specifies a city/county. According to criterion, main city/county is acceptable, province alone not enough. Score 0.  
Score: 0

**idx_11:**  
Response: ""florida""  
Target: ""miamidadecounty,monroecounty,andcolliercounty""  
Analysis: Target has three counties, part of Florida state. Response only includes the province/state (Florida). Multiple addresses all need to correspond, so just state is not sufficient.  
Score: 0

**idx_12:**  
Response: ""philadelphia,pa""  
Target: ""philadelphia,commonwealthofpennsylvania""  
Analysis: Same city and state, different written form. Corresponds clearly.  
Score: 1

**idx_13:**  
Response: ""alaska""  
Target: ""yukonterritory(canada)andalaska(usa)andprovinceofbritishcolumbia(canada)""  
Analysis: Target has three regions: Yukon Territory, Alaska, and British Columbia. Response only has Alaska. Multiple addresses must all correspond. Score 0.  
Score: 0

**idx_14:**  
Response: ""collinsville,il""  
Target: ""st.claircounty,illinois""  
Analysis: Target is county level, response is township/city level. Collinsville is a city in St. Clair County, IL. City corresponds to the county. According to criterion, city/county interchange is acceptable.  
Score: 1

**idx_15:**  
Response: ""newyork""  
Target: ""newyork,newyork""  
Analysis: Both city and state the same. Response only says ""newyork"" - ambiguous but typically interpreted as New York City or State. Since both city and state same name, response matches the city name. Corresponds.  
Score: 1

**idx_16:**  
Response: ""newmexico""

**idx_17:**  
Response: ""charlottesville,va""  
Target: ""albemarlecounty,virginia""  
Analysis: Charlottesville is an independent city within Albemarle County, VA area (adjacent but distinct). The criterion says main city/county acceptable, so city for county is acceptable. Corresponds.

Criterion summary:  
- Semantics approximate or pointing to the same entity is sufficient.  
- Multiple addresses must all correspond.  
- For a specific location, main city/county is acceptable, just province is not enough.  

---

**idx_0:**  
Response: ""newfoundlandandlabrador""  
Target: ""newfoundland,newfoundlandandlabrador""  
Analysis: The response matches one of the two target locations exactly. The reference target includes “newfoundland” (a smaller region or part) and the larger Newfoundland and Labrador. Since the response includes the larger entity (province), it corresponds closely. This counts as correct.  
Score: 1

**idx_1:**  
Response: ""alberta""  
Target: ""fortmacleod,alberta""  
Analysis: Target specifies a city (Fort Macleod) in Alberta. Response only mentions the province. The criterion states: for a specific location, main city/county is acceptable, province alone is not enough. The target has a city+province, the response only has the province. So response misses the city detail. Not correct.  
Score: 0

**idx_2:**  
Response: ""northwestterritories""  
Target: ""albertaandnorthwestterritories,canada""  
Analysis: Target has two regions: Alberta and Northwest Territories, both in Canada. Response mentions only one of these two regions. The criterion requires all multiple addresses to correspond. Missing Alberta.  
Score: 0

**idx_3:**  
Response: ""alberta,britishcolumbia""  
Target: ""albertaandbritishcolumbia""  
Analysis: Both contain Alberta and British Columbia. Semantics correspond fully.  
Score: 1

**idx_4:**  
Response: ""québeccity""  
Target: ""cityofquebec""  
Analysis: Same city name (Québec City). Corresponds perfectly.  
Score: 1

**idx_5:**  
Response: ""alberta,montana""  
Target: ""provinceofalberta,canada;stateofmontana,usa""  
Analysis: Response has Alberta and Montana, matching the two places in the target. Semantics match.  
Score: 1

**idx_6:**  
Response: ""stateofmexico""  
Target: ""mexicocity""  
Analysis: Mexico City is a city, ""State of Mexico"" is a separate federal entity/state surrounding Mexico City but different. The criterion says semantics must approximately correspond or point to the same entity. These are two different entities. Not correct.  
Score: 0

**idx_7:**  
Response: ""stateofmexico""  
Target: ""teotihuacán,stateofmexico,mexico""  
Analysis: Target includes Teotihuacán (a specific site), state of Mexico (entity), Mexico (country). Response only has the state of Mexico. Missing Teotihuacán and Mexico explicitly. However, since the main location is state of Mexico and it's included in both, partial. But the target is multiple locations: Teotihuacán and state of Mexico and Mexico (country). Multiple addresses require all correspond. Response is missing the first, Teotihuacán.  
Score: 0

**idx_8:**  
Response: ""veracruz""  
Target: ""veracruz,mexico""  
Analysis: Matching location Veracruz; country info missing in response but not required if main city/county is given. Corresponds sufficiently.  
Score: 1

**idx_9:**  
Response: ""michoacán""  
Target: ""michoacán,mexico""  
Analysis: Same as above, region corresponds. Country omitted but ok. Corresponds.  
Score: 1

**idx_10:**  
Response: ""colorado""  
Target: ""montezumacounty,colorado,""  
Analysis: Target is a county in Colorado. Response only gives the state (Colorado). Province/state alone not enough if target specifies a city/county. According to criterion, main city/county is acceptable, province alone not enough. Score 0.  
Score: 0

**idx_11:**  
Response: ""florida""  
Target: ""miamidadecounty,monroecounty,andcolliercounty""  
Analysis: Target has three counties, part of Florida state. Response only includes the province/state (Florida). Multiple addresses all need to correspond, so just state is not sufficient.  
Score: 0

**idx_12:**  
Response: ""philadelphia,pa""  
Target: ""philadelphia,commonwealthofpennsylvania""  
Analysis: Same city and state, different written form. Corresponds clearly.  
Score: 1

**idx_13:**  
Response: ""alaska""  
Target: ""yukonterritory(canada)andalaska(usa)andprovinceofbritishcolumbia(canada)""  
Analysis: Target has three regions: Yukon Territory, Alaska, and British Columbia. Response only has Alaska. Multiple addresses must all correspond. Score 0.  
Score: 0

**idx_14:**  
Response: ""collinsville,il""  
Target: ""st.claircounty,illinois""  
Analysis: Target is county level, response is township/city level. Collinsville is a city in St. Clair County, IL. City corresponds to the county. According to criterion, city/county interchange is acceptable.  
Score: 1

**idx_15:**  
Response: ""newyork""  
Target: ""newyork,newyork""  
Analysis: Both city and state the same. Response only says ""newyork"" - ambiguous but typically interpreted as New York City or State. Since both city and state same name, response matches the city name. Corresponds.  
Score: 1

**idx_16:**  
Response: ""newmexico""  
Target: ""sanjuancounty,newmexico""  
Analysis: Target specifies county and state; response only state. State alone not enough if target specifies city/county.  
Score: 0

**idx_17:**  
Response: ""charlottesville,va""  
Target: ""albemarlecounty,virginia""  
Analysis: Charlottesville is an independent city within Albemarle County, VA area (adjacent but distinct). The criterion says main city/county acceptable, so city for county is acceptable. Corresponds.  
Score: 1

---

**idx_0:**  
Response: ""newfoundlandandlabrador""  
Target: ""newfoundland,newfoundlandandlabrador""  
Analysis: The response matches one of the two target locations exactly. The reference target includes “newfoundland” (a smaller region or part) and the larger Newfoundland and Labrador. Since the response includes the larger entity (province), it corresponds closely. This counts as correct.  
Score: 1

**idx_1:**  
Response: ""alberta""  
Target: ""fortmacleod,alberta""  
Analysis: Target specifies a city (Fort Macleod) in Alberta. Response only mentions the province. The criterion states: for a specific location, main city/county is acceptable, province alone is not enough. The target has a city+province, the response only has the province. So response misses the city detail. Not correct.  
Score: 0

**idx_2:**  
Response: ""northwestterritories""  
Target: ""albertaandnorthwestterritories,canada""  
Analysis: Target has two regions: Alberta and Northwest Territories, both in Canada. Response mentions only one of these two regions. The criterion requires all multiple addresses to correspond. Missing Alberta.  
Score: 0

**idx_3:**  
Response: ""alberta,britishcolumbia""  
Target: ""albertaandbritishcolumbia""  
Analysis: Both contain Alberta and British Columbia. Semantics correspond fully.  
Score: 1

**idx_4:**  
Response: ""québeccity""  
Target: ""cityofquebec""  
Analysis: Same city name (Québec City). Corresponds perfectly.  
Score: 1

**idx_5:**  
Response: ""alberta,montana""  
Target: ""provinceofalberta,canada;stateofmontana,usa""  
Analysis: Response has Alberta and Montana, matching the two places in the target. Semantics match.  
Score: 1

**idx_6:**  
Response: ""stateofmexico""  
Target: ""mexicocity""  
Analysis: Mexico City is a city, ""State of Mexico"" is a separate federal entity/state surrounding Mexico City but different. The criterion says semantics must approximately correspond or point to the same entity. These are two different entities. Not correct.  
Score: 0

**idx_7:**  
Response: ""stateofmexico""  
Target: ""teotihuacán,stateofmexico,mexico""  
Analysis: Target includes Teotihuacán (a specific site), state of Mexico (entity), Mexico (country). Response only has the state of Mexico. Missing Teotihuacán and Mexico explicitly. However, since the main location is state of Mexico and it's included in both, partial. But the target is multiple locations: Teotihuacán and state of Mexico and Mexico (country). Multiple addresses require all correspond. Response is missing the first, Teotihuacán.  
Score: 0

**idx_8:**  
Response: ""veracruz""  
Target: ""veracruz,mexico""  
Analysis: Matching location Veracruz; country info missing in response but not required if main city/county is given. Corresponds sufficiently.  
Score: 1

**idx_9:**  
Response: ""michoacán""  
Target: ""michoacán,mexico""  
Analysis: Same as above, region corresponds. Country omitted but ok. Corresponds.  
Score: 1

**idx_10:**  
Response: ""colorado""  
Target: ""montezumacounty,colorado,""  
Analysis: Target is a county in Colorado. Response only gives the state (Colorado). Province/state alone not enough if target specifies a city/county. According to criterion, main city/county is acceptable, province alone not enough. Score 0.  
Score: 0

**idx_11:**  
Response: ""florida""  
Target: ""miamidadecounty,monroecounty,andcolliercounty""  
Analysis: Target has three counties, part of Florida state. Response only includes the province/state (Florida). Multiple addresses all need to correspond, so just state is not sufficient.  
Score: 0

**idx_12:**  
Response: ""philadelphia,pa""  
Target: ""philadelphia,commonwealthofpennsylvania""  
Analysis: Same city and state, different written form. Corresponds clearly.  
Score: 1

**idx_13:**  
Response: ""alaska""  
Target: ""yukonterritory(canada)andalaska(usa)andprovinceofbritishcolumbia(canada)""  
Analysis: Target has three regions: Yukon Territory, Alaska, and British Columbia. Response only has Alaska. Multiple addresses must all correspond. Score 0.  
Score: 0

**idx_14:**  
Response: ""collinsville,il""  
Target: ""st.claircounty,illinois""  
Analysis: Target is county level, response is township/city level. Collinsville is a city in St. Clair County, IL. City corresponds to the county. According to criterion, city/county interchange is acceptable.  
Score: 1

**idx_15:**  
Response: ""newyork""  
Target: ""newyork,newyork""  
Analysis: Both city and state the same. Response only says ""newyork"" - ambiguous but typically interpreted as New York City or State. Since both city and state same name, response matches the city name. Corresponds.  
Score: 1

**idx_16:**  
Response: ""newmexico""

**idx_17:**  
Response: ""charlottesville,va""  
Target: ""albemarlecounty,virginia""  
Analysis: Charlottesville is an independent city within Albemarle County, VA area (adjacent but distinct). The criterion says main city/county acceptable, so city for county is acceptable. Corresponds.

Score: 0

**idx_11:**  
Response: ""florida""

---

**idx_0:**  
Response: ""newfoundlandandlabrador""  
Target: ""newfoundland,newfoundlandandlabrador""  
Analysis: The response matches one of the two target locations exactly. The reference target includes “newfoundland” (a smaller region or part) and the larger Newfoundland and Labrador. Since the response includes the larger entity (province), it corresponds closely. This counts as correct.  
Score: 1

**idx_1:**  
Response: ""alberta""  
Target: ""fortmacleod,alberta""  
Analysis: Target specifies a city (Fort Macleod) in Alberta. Response only mentions the province. The criterion states: for a specific location, main city/county is acceptable, province alone is not enough. The target has a city+province, the response only has the province. So response misses the city detail. Not correct.  
Score: 0

**idx_2:**  
Response: ""northwestterritories""

Analysis: Response has Alberta and Montana, matching the two places in the target. Semantics match.  
Score: 1

**idx_6:**  
Response: ""stateofmexico""  
Target: ""mexicocity""  
Analysis: Mexico City is a city, ""State of Mexico"" is a separate federal entity/state surrounding Mexico City but different. The criterion says semantics must approximately correspond or point to the same entity. These are two different entities. Not correct.  
Score: 0

**idx_7:**  
Response: ""stateofmexico""  
Target: ""teotihuacán,stateofmexico,mexico""  
Analysis: Target includes Teotihuacán (a specific site), state of Mexico (entity), Mexico (country). Response only has the state of Mexico. Missing Teotihuacán and Mexico explicitly. However, since the main location is state of Mexico and it's included in both, partial. But the target is multiple locations: Teotihuacán and state of Mexico and Mexico (country). Multiple addresses require all correspond. Response is missing the first, Teotihuacán.

Criterion summary:  
- Semantics approximate or pointing to the same entity is sufficient.  
- Multiple addresses must all correspond.  
- For a specific location, main city/county is acceptable, just province is not enough.  

---

**idx_0:**  
Response: ""newfoundlandandlabrador""  
Target: ""newfoundland,newfoundlandandlabrador""  
Analysis: The response matches one of the two target locations exactly. The reference target includes “newfoundland” (a smaller region or part) and the larger Newfoundland and Labrador. Since the response includes the larger entity (province), it corresponds closely. This counts as correct.  
Score: 1

**idx_1:**  
Response: ""alberta""  
Target: ""fortmacleod,alberta""  
Analysis: Target specifies a city (Fort Macleod) in Alberta. Response only mentions the province. The criterion states: for a specific location, main city/county is acceptable, province alone is not enough. The target has a city+province, the response only has the province. So response misses the city detail. Not correct.  
Score: 0

**idx_2:**  
Response: ""northwestterritories""  
Target: ""albertaandnorthwestterritories,canada""  
Analysis: Target has two regions: Alberta and Northwest Territories, both in Canada. Response mentions only one of these two regions. The criterion requires all multiple addresses to correspond. Missing Alberta.  
Score: 0

**idx_3:**  
Response: ""alberta,britishcolumbia""  
Target: ""albertaandbritishcolumbia""  
Analysis: Both contain Alberta and British Columbia. Semantics correspond fully.  
Score: 1

**idx_4:**  
Response: ""québeccity""  
Target: ""cityofquebec""  
Analysis: Same city name (Québec City). Corresponds perfectly.  
Score: 1

**idx_5:**  
Response: ""alberta,montana""  
Target: ""provinceofalberta,canada;stateofmontana,usa""  
Analysis: Response has Alberta and Montana, matching the two places in the target. Semantics match.  
Score: 1

**idx_6:**  
Response: ""stateofmexico""  
Target: ""mexicocity""  
Analysis: Mexico City is a city, ""State of Mexico"" is a separate federal entity/state surrounding Mexico City but different. The criterion says semantics must approximately correspond or point to the same entity. These are two different entities. Not correct.  
Score: 0

**idx_7:**  
Response: ""stateofmexico""  
Target: ""teotihuacán,stateofmexico,mexico""  
Analysis: Target includes Teotihuacán (a specific site), state of Mexico (entity), Mexico (country). Response only has the state of Mexico. Missing Teotihuacán and Mexico explicitly. However, since the main location is state of Mexico and it's included in both, partial. But the target is multiple locations: Teotihuacán and state of Mexico and Mexico (country). Multiple addresses require all correspond. Response is missing the first, Teotihuacán.  
Score: 0

**idx_8:**  
Response: ""veracruz""  
Target: ""veracruz,mexico""  
Analysis: Matching location Veracruz; country info missing in response but not required if main city/county is given. Corresponds sufficiently.  
Score: 1

**idx_9:**  
Response: ""michoacán""  
Target: ""michoacán,mexico""  
Analysis: Same as above, region corresponds. Country omitted but ok. Corresponds.  
Score: 1

**idx_10:**  
Response: ""colorado""  
Target: ""montezumacounty,colorado,""  
Analysis: Target is a county in Colorado. Response only gives the state (Colorado). Province/state alone not enough if target specifies a city/county. According to criterion, main city/county is acceptable, province alone not enough. Score 0.  
Score: 0

**idx_11:**  
Response: ""florida""  
Target: ""miamidadecounty,monroecounty,andcolliercounty""  
Analysis: Target has three counties, part of Florida state. Response only includes the province/state (Florida). Multiple addresses all need to correspond, so just state is not sufficient.  
Score: 0

**idx_12:**  
Response: ""philadelphia,pa""  
Target: ""philadelphia,commonwealthofpennsylvania""  
Analysis: Same city and state, different written form. Corresponds clearly.  
Score: 1

**idx_13:**  
Response: ""alaska""  
Target: ""yukonterritory(canada)andalaska(usa)andprovinceofbritishcolumbia(canada)""  
Analysis: Target has three regions: Yukon Territory, Alaska, and British Columbia. Response only has Alaska. Multiple addresses must all correspond. Score 0.  
Score: 0

**idx_14:**  
Response: ""collinsville,il""  
Target: ""st.claircounty,illinois""  
Analysis: Target is county level, response is township/city level. Collinsville is a city in St. Clair County, IL. City corresponds to the county. According to criterion, city/county interchange is acceptable.  
Score: 1

**idx_15:**  
Response: ""newyork""  
Target: ""newyork,newyork""  
Analysis: Both city and state the same. Response only says ""newyork"" - ambiguous but typically interpreted as New York City or State. Since both city and state same name, response matches the city name. Corresponds.  
Score: 1

**idx_16:**  
Response: ""newmexico""  
Target: ""sanjuancounty,newmexico""  
Analysis: Target specifies county and state; response only state. State alone not enough if target specifies city/county.  
Score: 0

**idx_17:**  
Response: ""charlottesville,va""  
Target: ""albemarlecounty,virginia""  
Analysis: Charlottesville is an independent city within Albemarle County, VA area (adjacent but distinct). The criterion says main city/county acceptable, so city for county is acceptable. Corresponds.  
Score: 1

Target: ""fortmacleod,alberta""  
Analysis: Target specifies a city (Fort Macleod) in Alberta. Response only mentions the province. The criterion states: for a specific location, main city/county is acceptable, province alone is not enough. The target has a city+province, the response only has the province. So response misses the city detail. Not correct.  
Score: 0

**idx_2:**  
Response: ""northwestterritories""  
Target: ""albertaandnorthwestterritories,canada""  
Analysis: Target has two regions: Alberta and Northwest Territories, both in Canada. Response mentions only one of these two regions. The criterion requires all multiple addresses to correspond. Missing Alberta.

**idx_6:**  
Response: ""stateofmexico""  
Target: ""mexicocity""  
Analysis: Mexico City is a city, ""State of Mexico"" is a separate federal entity/state surrounding Mexico City but different. The criterion says semantics must approximately correspond or point to the same entity. These are two different entities. Not correct.  
Score: 0

**idx_7:**  
Response: ""stateofmexico""  
Target: ""teotihuacán,stateofmexico,mexico""  
Analysis: Target includes Teotihuacán (a specific site), state of Mexico (entity), Mexico (country). Response only has the state of Mexico. Missing Teotihuacán and Mexico explicitly. However, since the main location is state of Mexico and it's included in both, partial. But the target is multiple locations: Teotihuacán and state of Mexico and Mexico (country). Multiple addresses require all correspond. Response is missing the first, Teotihuacán.  
Score: 0

  - Semantics roughly the same, pointing to the same entity.
  - Score: 1

- idx_5:
  - response: ""can""
  - target: ""canada,unitedstatesofamerica""
  - response only has ""can"" (Canada), target expects Canada + USA.
  - Response misses United States of America.
  - Since response lacks one entity that target has, response is incomplete.

Criterion summary:  
- Semantics approximate or pointing to the same entity is sufficient.  
- Multiple addresses must all correspond.  
- For a specific location, main city/county is acceptable, just province is not enough.  

---

**idx_0:**  
Response: ""newfoundlandandlabrador""  
Target: ""newfoundland,newfoundlandandlabrador""  
Analysis: The response matches one of the two target locations exactly. The reference target includes “newfoundland” (a smaller region or part) and the larger Newfoundland and Labrador. Since the response includes the larger entity (province), it corresponds closely. This counts as correct.  
Score: 1

**idx_1:**  
Response: ""alberta""  
Target: ""fortmacleod,alberta""  
Analysis: Target specifies a city (Fort Macleod) in Alberta. Response only mentions the province. The criterion states: for a specific location, main city/county is acceptable, province alone is not enough. The target has a city+province, the response only has the province. So response misses the city detail. Not correct.  
Score: 0

**idx_2:**  
Response: ""northwestterritories""  
Target: ""albertaandnorthwestterritories,canada""  
Analysis: Target has two regions: Alberta and Northwest Territories, both in Canada. Response mentions only one of these two regions. The criterion requires all multiple addresses to correspond. Missing Alberta.  
Score: 0

**idx_3:**  
Response: ""alberta,britishcolumbia""  
Target: ""albertaandbritishcolumbia""  
Analysis: Both contain Alberta and British Columbia. Semantics correspond fully.  
Score: 1

**idx_4:**  
Response: ""québeccity""  
Target: ""cityofquebec""  
Analysis: Same city name (Québec City). Corresponds perfectly.  
Score: 1

**idx_5:**  
Response: ""alberta,montana""  
Target: ""provinceofalberta,canada;stateofmontana,usa""  
Analysis: Response has Alberta and Montana, matching the two places in the target. Semantics match.  
Score: 1

**idx_6:**  
Response: ""stateofmexico""  
Target: ""mexicocity""  
Analysis: Mexico City is a city, ""State of Mexico"" is a separate federal entity/state surrounding Mexico City but different. The criterion says semantics must approximately correspond or point to the same entity. These are two different entities. Not correct.  
Score: 0

**idx_7:**  
Response: ""stateofmexico""  
Target: ""teotihuacán,stateofmexico,mexico""  
Analysis: Target includes Teotihuacán (a specific site), state of Mexico (entity), Mexico (country). Response only has the state of Mexico. Missing Teotihuacán and Mexico explicitly. However, since the main location is state of Mexico and it's included in both, partial. But the target is multiple locations: Teotihuacán and state of Mexico and Mexico (country). Multiple addresses require all correspond. Response is missing the first, Teotihuacán.  
Score: 0

**idx_8:**  
Response: ""veracruz""  
Target: ""veracruz,mexico""  
Analysis: Matching location Veracruz; country info missing in response but not required if main city/county is given. Corresponds sufficiently.  
Score: 1

**idx_9:**  
Response: ""michoacán""  
Target: ""michoacán,mexico""  
Analysis: Same as above, region corresponds. Country omitted but ok. Corresponds.  
Score: 1

**idx_10:**  
Response: ""colorado""  
Target: ""montezumacounty,colorado,""  
Analysis: Target is a county in Colorado. Response only gives the state (Colorado). Province/state alone not enough if target specifies a city/county. According to criterion, main city/county is acceptable, province alone not enough. Score 0.  
Score: 0

**idx_11:**  
Response: ""florida""  
Target: ""miamidadecounty,monroecounty,andcolliercounty""  
Analysis: Target has three counties, part of Florida state. Response only includes the province/state (Florida). Multiple addresses all need to correspond, so just state is not sufficient.  
Score: 0

**idx_12:**  
Response: ""philadelphia,pa""  
Target: ""philadelphia,commonwealthofpennsylvania""  
Analysis: Same city and state, different written form. Corresponds clearly.  
Score: 1

**idx_13:**  
Response: ""alaska""  
Target: ""yukonterritory(canada)andalaska(usa)andprovinceofbritishcolumbia(canada)""  
Analysis: Target has three regions: Yukon Territory, Alaska, and British Columbia. Response only has Alaska. Multiple addresses must all correspond. Score 0.  
Score: 0

**idx_14:**  
Response: ""collinsville,il""  
Target: ""st.claircounty,illinois""  
Analysis: Target is county level, response is township/city level. Collinsville is a city in St. Clair County, IL. City corresponds to the county. According to criterion, city/county interchange is acceptable.  
Score: 1

**idx_15:**  
Response: ""newyork""  
Target: ""newyork,newyork""  
Analysis: Both city and state the same. Response only says ""newyork"" - ambiguous but typically interpreted as New York City or State. Since both city and state same name, response matches the city name. Corresponds.  
Score: 1

**idx_16:**  
Response: ""newmexico""  
Target: ""sanjuancounty,newmexico""  
Analysis: Target specifies county and state; response only state. State alone not enough if target specifies city/county.  
Score: 0

**idx_17:**  
Response: ""charlottesville,va""  
Target: ""albemarlecounty,virginia""  
Analysis: Charlottesville is an independent city within Albemarle County, VA area (adjacent but distinct). The criterion says main city/county acceptable, so city for county is acceptable. Corresponds.  
Score: 1
