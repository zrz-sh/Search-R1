argentina,Argentina,,,2024parisolympics,2024 Paris Olympics,1.0,key_match,0.0,"Let's analyze each pair according to the criterion:

Criterion recap:
- Semantics approximately the same as the reference or pointing to the same entity suffices.
- No need for word-for-word matching.

---

**idx_0**  
- Response: ""cycling""  
- Target: ""bicycle""  
Analysis:  
- Cycling is the activity related to a bicycle; the target is ""bicycle"" which is an object, not the activity.  
- The response is an activity related to the object ""bicycle"". Since the criterion allows for approximate semantics pointing to the same entity, but ""bicycle"" and ""cycling"" are related but not the same entity.  
- The response does not exactly match the target (object vs activity). The question presumably expects ""bicycle"" (the noun), but gives ""cycling"" (the activity). Based on the criterion, ""cycling"" and ""bicycle"" are different entities (object vs activity), so do not fully match.  
Score: 0

---

**idx_1**  
- Response: ""rowing""  
- Target: ""judo,gymnastics,volleyball""  
Analysis:  
- Response is a single sport: rowing. Target is three different sports: judo, gymnastics, volleyball.  
- None of the response matches the targets.  
Score: 0

---

**idx_2**  
- Response: ""football""  
- Target: ""canoeing,surfing,gymnastics,sailing,swimming,boxing,football""  
Analysis:  
- The response ""football"" is included in the target list.  
- Since response matches one of the targets exactly, it is considered correct.  
Score: 1

---

**idx_3**  
- Response: ""judo,cycling""  
- Target: ""judo,sailing,hockey""  
Analysis:  
- Response has ""judo"" and ""cycling""  
- Target has ""judo"", ""sailing"", ""hockey""  
- ""judo"" matches exactly, ""cycling"" does not match ""sailing"" or ""hockey"".  
- The response contains at least one correct entity matching the target, which is ""judo"".  
- The criterion states approximate semantics or pointing to the same entity suffices, but since part of the response is correct, and the other is irrelevant but no penalty mentioned, I judge this as correct.  
Score: 1

**idx_4**  
- Response: ""sailing,football,judo""  
- Target: ""judo,athletics,boxing,sailing,volleyball(2),football""  
Analysis:  
- Response lists three sports: sailing, football, judo  
- All three appear in the target list.  
- Perfect or near-perfect match in terms of entities.
