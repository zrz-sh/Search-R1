argentina,Argentina,,,2016rioolympics,2016 Rio Olympics,1.0,key_match,0.0,"Let's analyze each response against its target according to the criterion given:

---

### idx_0

- **Target:** judo, sailing, hockey  
- **Response:** football, athletics, swimming, boxing, judo, wrestling, shooting, taekwondo, canoeslalom, basketball

**Comparison:**  
- Response contains **judo**, which matches the target.  
- Response does **not** include sailing or hockey.  
- The criterion states it is sufficient if the semantics are *approximately the same* or they point to the same entity. The response at least contains one correct entity (judo), but not all entities in the target.

Since this is presumably a list-type answer (sports), partial overlap might be considered insufficient for a full score. The criterion is lenient about semantics but the response misses 2 out of 3 target items. The provided grading criteria do not specify partial credit; score must be 0 or 1.

Is the overlap ""approximately the same""? The response lists 10 different sports, only 1 matches the target list of 3 sports. This is not approximately the same set or referring to the same entities. More like a mismatch.

**Conclusion:** score 0.

---

### idx_1

- **Target:** judo, athletics, boxing, sailing, volleyball(2), football  
- **Response:** gymnastics, wrestling, canoeslalom

**Comparison:**  
- Response lists gymnastics, wrestling, canoeslalom  
- None of these match the 6 target entities.  
- No semantic equivalence or same entities pointed out.

**Conclusion:** score 0.
