**idx_0**  
response: ""2002""  
target: ""-"" (no target answer)  
With no target answer provided, it's impossible to judge correctness. Normally, such pairs would be scored based on whether response matches a known answer or any provided target. Since none is given, treat this as no answer to compare, so score = 0.

**idx_1**  
response: ""2002""  
target: ""-"" (no target answer)

**idx_2**

""2008"" vs ""2010"" are different years. They do not point to the same entity or the same year, so score = 0.

**idx_3**  
response: ""2008""  
target: ""2009""  
""2008"" vs ""2009"" differ by 1 year, but they do not point to the exact same entity. The criterion says roughly semantically the same or the same entity. Different years are different entities in this case. No indication that one is acceptable if close. So, score = 0.

**idx_4**

**idx_0**  
response: ""2002""  
target: ""-"" (no target answer)  
With no target answer provided, it's impossible to judge correctness. Normally, such pairs would be scored based on whether response matches a known answer or any provided target. Since none is given, treat this as no answer to compare, so score = 0.

**idx_1**  
response: ""2002""  
target: ""-"" (no target answer)  
Same situation as idx_0, no target to compare, score = 0.

**idx_2**  
response: ""2008""  
target: ""2010""  
""2008"" vs ""2010"" are different years. They do not point to the same entity or the same year, so score = 0.

**idx_3**  
response: ""2008""  
target: ""2009""  
""2008"" vs ""2009"" differ by 1 year, but they do not point to the exact same entity. The criterion says roughly semantically the same or the same entity. Different years are different entities in this case. No indication that one is acceptable if close. So, score = 0.

**idx_4**  
response: ""2010""  
target: ""2010""  
Exactly the same, score = 1.

**idx_5**  
response: ""2015""

Different years, no indication close years accepted, score = 0.

**idx_6**

Different years, score = 0.
