Criterion: It is sufficient if the semantics are approximately the same or if they point to the same entity. No word-for-word correspondence needed.

**idx_0**:  
- Response: ""2hr1min""  
- Target: ""118min""  
- Convert response to minutes: 2hr * 60 + 1 = 121 minutes  
- Target: 118 minutes  
- Difference: 3 minutes  
- Semantics approximate the same meaning (both refer to about two hours). The response says 121 minutes, and the target is 118 minutes, which is close enough, so it points to the same entity (duration around 2 hours).

,,thelaundromat,The Laundromat,1.0,"Let's analyze each pair step by step according to the grading criterion:

Criterion summary: 
- Semantics approximately the same as the reference or pointing to the same entity is sufficient.
- The response only needs to be a subset of the reference answer.
- Score: 0 or 1.

Analysis:

1. idx_0:  
   - response: ""usa""  
   - target: ""usa/canada""  
   The target includes ""usa"" as one of the entities. The response ""usa"" is a subset of the target. This meets the criterion.

2. idx_1:  
   - response: ""australia""  
   - target: ""australia""  
   Exact match.  
   -> score = 1

3. idx_2:  
   - response: ""usa""  
   - target: ""usa/brazil/mainlandchina""  
   The response ""usa"" is part of the reference answer entities. Meets the criterion.  
   -> score = 1

4. idx_3:  
   - response: ""usa""  
   - target: ""uk/usa""  
   Response is part of the target. Meets the criterion.

Criterion summary:
- Semantics approximately the same or pointing to the same entity is sufficient.
- No need for word-for-word match.
- Classifications can differ as long as the core meaning/entity is the same or relevant.

---

**idx_0**  
- Response: ""drama""  
- Target: ""drama/thriller/crime""  
Analysis: The response correctly identifies ""drama"" which is part of the target genres. Since the response's genre is included in the target genre list, the semantics are approximately the same. This is sufficient for a score of 1.

---

**idx_1**  
- Response: ""drama""  
- Target: ""drama/comedy/romance""  
Analysis: The response ""drama"" matches one of the genres in the target. Mixing classification is allowed, so pointing to the same entity ""drama"" is sufficient. Score: 1.

---

**idx_2**  
- Response: ""sci-fi""  
- Target: ""sciencefiction/adventure""  
Analysis: ""sci-fi"" and ""sciencefiction"" essentially refer to the same genre (science fiction). The response touches on the same semantic category as the target. ""Adventure"" is an extra label in the target; its absence in the response is acceptable. Score: 1.

---

**idx_3**  
- Response: ""drama""  
- Target: ""drama/romance""  
Analysis: Response ""drama"" overlaps with one of the target genres. Sufficient semantic overlap. Score: 1.

---

**idx_4**  
- Response: ""comedy-drama""  
- Target: ""comedy/drama/thriller/crime""  
Analysis: ""comedy-drama"" is a combined genre explicitly matching the ""comedy"" and ""drama"" parts of the target. It captures relevant subsets of the target genres. The rest of the target genres (thriller/crime) are extra and not required. Score: 1.

---

All responses semantically correspond to at least part of the target answer's genres. Hence all get score 1.
