whenthephonerings,When the Phone Rings,,,0.0,"Let's analyze each pair according to the criterion:

Criterion summary:  
""It is sufficient if the semantics are approximately the same as the reference answer or if they point to the same entity. There is no need for a word-for-word correspondence.""

Given the input:  
Response and target pairs:  
- idx_0: response = ""bestactress"", target = ""/""  
- idx_1: response = ""bestseries"", target = ""/""  

Analysis for idx_0:  
- Target is ""/"", which seems to mean either empty or some kind of placeholder with no content.  
- Response is ""bestactress"" which is a semantic entity or label.  
Since the target is ""/"", which probably indicates no valid answer or no reference answer, the response ""bestactress"" does not match the target. There is no semantic match or even a similar entity. Therefore, score = 0.

Analysis for idx_1:  
- Target is ""/"" again, likely no answer or placeholder.  
- Response is ""bestseries,"" a semantic phrase pointing to some category or entity.  
Since target is empty placeholder, and response is something specific, no match. So score = 0.

Final scoring:  
```json
{
  ""idx_0"": 0,
  ""idx_1"": 0
}
```",/,bestactress,0.0,"Let's analyze each pair based on the grading criterion:

Criterion summary:  
- The response is considered correct if its semantics are approximately the same as the reference answer or if they point to the same entity.  
- Word-for-word match is not necessary, but the meaning or the entity referenced should be the same.

---

### idx_0

- Response: ""kimhyun-joong""  
- Target: ""parksang-woo, wideuk-gyu""

Analysis:  
- The response gives a name ""kimhyun-joong.""  
- The targets are ""parksang-woo"" and ""wideuk-gyu,"" two different names from the response.  
- None of the names match or point to the same entity.  
- Therefore, the response does not satisfy the criterion (semantics/entity match).

Score: 0

### idx_1

- Response: ""leesang-ho""  
- Target: ""hwangdong-hyuk""

Analysis:  
- Response gives ""leesang-ho,"" target is ""hwangdong-hyuk.""  
- These are different names/entities.  
- They do not refer to the same entity or approximate semantics.
