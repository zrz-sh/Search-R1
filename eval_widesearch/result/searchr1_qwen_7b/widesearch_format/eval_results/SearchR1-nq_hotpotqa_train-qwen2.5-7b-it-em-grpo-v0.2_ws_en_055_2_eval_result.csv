---

**idx_0**  
- Response: ""thewaltdisneycompany""  
- Target: ""thewaltdisneycompany""  
- Analysis: Exact match, same entity. Score = 1

**idx_1**  
- Response: ""thewaltdisneycompany""  
- Target: ""thewaltdisneycompany""  
- Analysis: Exact match, same entity. Score = 1

**idx_2**  
- Response: ""universalparks&resorts""  
- Target: ""universaldestinations&experiences""  
- Analysis: Although the wording differs, both refer to the major division of Universal managing their theme parks and experiences. These are essentially the same entity under different trade names (Universal Parks & Resorts was rebranded to Universal Destinations & Experiences). Considering the criterion allows approximate semantics and pointing to the same entity, this should be accepted. Score = 1

**idx_3**  
- Response: ""thewaltdisneycompany""  
- Target: ""theorientallandcompany(licensedbydisney)""  
- Analysis: The response says ""thewaltdisneycompany"", but the target is ""theorientallandcompany (licensed by disney)"". These are related but distinct legal entities: The Oriental Land Company operates Tokyo Disney Resort under license from The Walt Disney Company. They are not the same entity. The answer and response do not point to the same entity, even roughly. So this is incorrect. Score = 0
