### Items 8-9:

Target = ""小米su7""

Response:

- idx_8: 威马w6  
- idx_9: 极氪x  

The target is a Xiaomi SU7 car. Responses are:

No semantic or entity match here either, so these also get 0.

---

**Summary:** None of the responses match the target car entity or refer to the same entity closely enough to be scored 1.
