Criterion Summary:  
- Semantics should be approximately the same or point to the same entity.  
- No need for word-for-word; approximate equivalence or same entity is sufficient.

  - 2001 20th Hong Kong Film Awards Best Actor  
  - The 1st Chinese Film Media Awards Best Actor

- **Response:**  
  - hongkongfilmaward

**Analysis:**  
- Response only mentions ""hongkongfilmaward"" (presumably Hong Kong Film Award).  
- Target mentions specifically ""20th Hong Kong Film Awards Best Actor"" and also two other awards.  
- Response covers only one of the three target awards, but it correctly points to the Hong Kong Film Award entity in the target.  
- The criterion says it's sufficient if semantics are approximately the same or point to the same entity.  
- Response mentions only one award whereas target lists three, but the response corresponds to one of the awards in the target (Hong Kong Film Awards Best Actor).  
- Since criterion does not require exhaustive coverage but approximate same meaning or same entity for scoring, this partial match should be sufficient to count as correct.

  - Outstanding Actor Award at the 9th Asian Film Expo  
  - Best Chinese Actor Award at the 4th Douban Film Awards

- **Response:**  
  - youthfilmmanualaward,bestdirector

**Analysis:**  
- Response mentions ""youthfilmmanualaward"" and ""bestdirector"" (award categories/awards that are not related to best actor).  
- Target is about ""best actor"" or equivalent best actor awards.  
- There is no direct or approximate correspondence; the response does not mention any best actor awards or relate directly to any of the target awards.  
- Different award names and categories.  
- Therefore, semantics do not match nor point to the same entity.

- No semantic equivalence or entity matching with best actor.  
- Hence, no match.

  - hongkongfilmaward

**Analysis:**  
- Response only mentions ""hongkongfilmaward"" (presumably Hong Kong Film Award).  
- Target mentions specifically ""20th Hong Kong Film Awards Best Actor"" and also two other awards.  
- Response covers only one of the three target awards, but it correctly points to the Hong Kong Film Award entity in the target.  
- The criterion says it's sufficient if semantics are approximately the same or point to the same entity.  
- Response mentions only one award whereas target lists three, but the response corresponds to one of the awards in the target (Hong Kong Film Awards Best Actor).  
- Since criterion does not require exhaustive coverage but approximate same meaning or same entity for scoring, this partial match should be sufficient to count as correct.

**Score:** 1

### idx_1

- **Target:**  
  - The Hong Kong Film Directors’ Guild Awards: Best Actor  
  - Outstanding Actor Award at the 9th Asian Film Expo  
  - Best Chinese Actor Award at the 4th Douban Film Awards

- **Response:**  
  - youthfilmmanualaward,bestdirector

**Analysis:**  
- Response mentions ""youthfilmmanualaward"" and ""bestdirector"" (award categories/awards that are not related to best actor).  
- Target is about ""best actor"" or equivalent best actor awards.  
- There is no direct or approximate correspondence; the response does not mention any best actor awards or relate directly to any of the target awards.  
- Different award names and categories.  
- Therefore, semantics do not match nor point to the same entity.

**Score:** 0

---

### idx_2

- **Target:**  
  - 36th Golden Rooster Awards - Best Actor - won

- **Response:**  
  - bestdirector,bestscreenplay

**Analysis:**  
- Target explicitly mentions best actor award.  
- Response mentions ""bestdirector"" and ""bestscreenplay"" which are different award categories.  
- No semantic equivalence or entity matching with best actor.  
- Hence, no match.

**Score:** 0

---

### idx_3

- **Target:**  
  - 42nd Hong Kong Film Awards - Best Actor - won  
  - Best Actor of the 2023 Hong Kong Film Directors' Guild Annual Awards  
  - Most Highlight Actor of the 2nd Hong Kong Online Film Critics Highlight Awards

- **Response:**  
  - bestcinematography,bestsounddesign

**Analysis:**  
- Target is about best actor awards.  
- Response mentions best cinematography and best sound design, unrelated award categories.  
- No semantic equivalence or pointing to the same entity.  
- No match.

**Score:** 0

Criterion:  
- It is sufficient if the semantics are approximately the same or if they point to the same entity. No need for word-for-word correspondence.

---

### idx_0  
**Response:** ""wongkar-wai""  
**Target:** ""karwaiwong""  

- These are names concatenated/arranged differently. ""karwaiwong"" likely refers to ""Wong Kar Wai"" but concatenated in the opposite order or missing spaces or hyphens.  
- ""wongkar-wai"" splits as ""Wong Kar Wai"", same person as ""karwaiwong"".  
- Semantically the same entity (the famous director Wong Kar Wai). The different format is acceptable given the criterion.  

**Score:** 1

---

### idx_1  
**Response:** ""wongkar-wai""  
**Target:** ""karwaiwong""  

- Same as idx_0. Hence, score = 1

---

### idx_2  
**Response:** ""chenger""  
**Target:** ""ercheng""  

- The response ""chenger"" vs target ""ercheng"" differ by letter arrangements and ordering.  
- Both contain the substring ""cheng"". However, ""chenger"" does not exactly correspond to ""ercheng"" in any meaningful way.  
- ""ercheng"" could be a name; ""chenger"" is likely a misspelling or different name.  
- The entities do NOT clearly point to the same entity as per the criterion.  
- Hence, score = 0

---

### idx_3  
**Response:** ""felixchong""  
**Target:** ""felixchong""  

- Exact match.  
- Score = 1

### idx_0  
- **Response:** '-' (dash)  
- **Target:** 'block2pictures(hongkong)\nocéanfilms(france)'  
- **Analysis:**  
  The response is just a dash, which likely means no answer or no related entity provided. The target mentions two entities: ""block2pictures(hongkong)"" and ""océanfilms(france)"". The response does not provide any semantics or point to the entities mentioned.  
- **Decision:** Score 0

### idx_1  
- **Response:** 'emperormotionpictures'  
- **Target:** 'larkfilmsdistribution(hongkong)\nchinafilmgroupcorporation(china)'  
- **Analysis:**  
  The target lists two entities: ""larkfilmsdistribution(hongkong)"" and ""chinafilmgroupcorporation(china)"". The response is ""emperormotionpictures"" which is a different entity and does not point to the same thing as the targets. No semantic or entity equivalence is present.  
- **Decision:** Score 0

### idx_2  
- **Response:** 'antikalpadistribution'  
- **Target:** 'polybonafilms\nchinafilmco.\nhuaxiafilm\nalibabapictures'  
- **Analysis:**  
  Target lists multiple entities: ""polybonafilms"", ""chinafilmco."", ""huaxiafilm"", ""alibabapictures"". The response is a single different entity ""antikalpadistribution"". No semantic or entity match.

**idx_0**  
- response: ""maggiecheung""  
- target: ""maggiecheung""  
They are exactly the same.  
Score: 1

---

**idx_1**  
- response: ""zhangziyi""  
- target: ""ziyizhang""  
Check if these two refer to the same entity: ""Zhang Ziyi"" is a well-known Chinese actress, and ""Ziyi Zhang"" or ""Ziyizhang"" (if written without space) is just the same name in reverse word order or merged. Given the criterion allowing approximate semantics and pointing to the same entity, this counts as the same.  
Score: 1

---

**idx_2**  
- response: ""zhouxun""  
- target: ""xunzhou""  
These appear to be the same two words but reversed order: ""Zhou Xun"" is a famous Chinese actress. So the response ""zhouxun"" and target ""xunzhou"" are the same name but different order. Since criterion allows approximate semantics or pointing to same entity, this counts as the same.  
Score: 1

---

**idx_3**  
- response: ""-""  
- target: ""charlenechoi""  
The response provides ""-"" which presumably means no answer, while the target is a specific name ""charlenechoi"". These are not approximately the same and do not point to the same entity.  
Score: 0
