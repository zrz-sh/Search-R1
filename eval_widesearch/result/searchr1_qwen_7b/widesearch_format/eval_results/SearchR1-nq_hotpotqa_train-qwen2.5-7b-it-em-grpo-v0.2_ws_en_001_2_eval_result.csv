**Criterion recap:**  
- Semantics approximately the same or pointing to the same entity is sufficient.  
- The month and day must be correct.  
- No need for word-for-word correspondence.  
- Score: 0 or 1.

---

**Analysis:**

- All responses are ""notspecified"".  
- Targets are specific dates (with some having times).

Since the response ""notspecified"" gives no date or time information, it does not match or approximate the target dates in any way.

Therefore, none of the responses match their targets in terms of month and day.
