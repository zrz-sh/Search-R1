---

**idx_0**  
- Target: ""universitycouncil""  
- Response: ""council""  

Analysis:  
The response ""council"" is a more general term than ""universitycouncil"". However, the criterion states that it is sufficient if the semantics are approximately the same or point to the same entity. Since ""council"" could be ambiguous and may not clearly specify ""university council,"" this response is partially correct but somewhat ambiguous. Given the lenient criterion (""approximately the same semantics"") and the fact that ""council"" likely refers to the same entity, we accept it as sufficiently correct.

Score: 1

---

**idx_1**  
- Target: ""theregenthouse""  
- Response: ""cambridgeuniversitycouncil""  

Analysis:  
""cambridgeuniversitycouncil"" and ""theregenthouse"" are clearly different entities. One is a council and the other is presumably a place (The Regent House). They do not refer to the same entity nor are their semantics approximately the same. This does not meet the criterion.
