```",drama/thriller/crime,"crime,thriller",1.0,"Let's analyze each pair of response and target according to the criterion:

Criterion: ""It is sufficient if the semantics are approximately the same as the reference answer or if they point to the same entity.""

In this context, the answers are numerical values (times in minutes). The reference answers are exact numbers (e.g., 118min), and the responses are close or different numbers.

Since the answers are numeric, and the question likely asks for a specific time, the standard practice would be to require an exact or nearly exact answer to be fully correct. However, the criterion states semantics approximately the same or pointing to the same entity is sufficient.

Numbers close to each other might be considered roughly the same value (depending on the tolerance). But the criterion does not define any numeric tolerance.

Given just numbers, ""approximately the same"" probably means close in value.

Let's inspect each:

1. idx_0  
   Response: 122 mins  
   Target: 118 min  
   Difference: 4 min  
   122 is close to 118, likely acceptable as approx same.

2. idx_1  
   Response: 94 mins  
   Target: 120 min  
   Difference: 26 min  
   Quite far apart, not approximately the same.

3. idx_2  
   Response: 134 mins  
   Target: 124 min  
   Difference: 10 min  
   Slightly farther, but possibly still approx the same?  
   10 min difference might be borderline. Without precise tolerance, let's consider ""approximately"" to mean within ~5 min. 10 min likely too far.

4. idx_3  
   Response: 135 mins  
   Target: 135 min  
   Exact match. Definitely correct.

5. idx_4  
   Response: 105 mins  
   Target: 76 min  
   Difference: 29 min  
   Not approximately same.

6. idx_5  
   Response: 103 mins  
   Target: 96 min  
   Difference: 7 min  
   Possibly borderline, but difference greater than 5 min. Probably no.

Given this, an assumed tolerance of ±5 minutes would suffice as ""approximately the same"". Above that, score 0; within or equal to 5, score 1.

Re-evaluate with this:

- idx_0: 4 min difference → score 1  
- idx_1: 26 min difference → score 0  
- idx_2: 10 min difference → score 0  
- idx_3: exactly same → score 1  
- idx_4: 29 min difference → score 0

- Semantics roughly the same or pointing to the same entity is sufficient.
- Relevance to the reference answer only.
- Inconsistencies in classification with the reference answer are permitted.
- Score either 0 or 1.

---

**idx_0**  
- Target: ""drama/thriller/crime""  
- Response: ""crime,thriller""  
Analysis: Response includes two of the three genres from target (thriller and crime). Drama is missing but inclusion of two relevant genres indicates strong semantic overlap. Since the criterion allows approximate semantics and pointing to the same entity, this should get 1.

**idx_1**  
- Target: ""drama/comedy/romance""  
- Response: ""drama""  
Analysis: Response contains one main genre ""drama"" which is included in the target set. It is relevant and points to the same entity broadly. Response is less comprehensive but criterion does not require full coverage. Score: 1.

**idx_2**  
- Target: ""sciencefiction/adventure""  
- Response: ""sci-fi""  
Analysis: ""sci-fi"" is a synonym/short for ""sciencefiction"". Response is semantically correct and relevant. Even though ""adventure"" is missing, not required to cover all. Score: 1.

**idx_3**  
- Target: ""drama/romance""  
- Response: ""comedy,drama""  
Analysis: Response shares ""drama"" with target, but adds comedy which is not in target. The presence of ""drama"" suggests relevance. Adding other genres is allowed as per the criterion. Score: 1.

**idx_4**

```",drama/romance,"comedy,drama",1.0,"Let's analyze each pair of response and target according to the criterion:

Criterion: ""It is sufficient if the semantics are approximately the same as the reference answer or if they point to the same entity.""

In this context, the answers are numerical values (times in minutes). The reference answers are exact numbers (e.g., 118min), and the responses are close or different numbers.

Since the answers are numeric, and the question likely asks for a specific time, the standard practice would be to require an exact or nearly exact answer to be fully correct. However, the criterion states semantics approximately the same or pointing to the same entity is sufficient.

Numbers close to each other might be considered roughly the same value (depending on the tolerance). But the criterion does not define any numeric tolerance.

Given just numbers, ""approximately the same"" probably means close in value.

Let's inspect each:

1. idx_0  
   Response: 122 mins  
   Target: 118 min  
   Difference: 4 min  
   122 is close to 118, likely acceptable as approx same.

2. idx_1  
   Response: 94 mins  
   Target: 120 min  
   Difference: 26 min  
   Quite far apart, not approximately the same.

3. idx_2  
   Response: 134 mins  
   Target: 124 min  
   Difference: 10 min  
   Slightly farther, but possibly still approx the same?  
   10 min difference might be borderline. Without precise tolerance, let's consider ""approximately"" to mean within ~5 min. 10 min likely too far.

4. idx_3  
   Response: 135 mins  
   Target: 135 min  
   Exact match. Definitely correct.

5. idx_4  
   Response: 105 mins  
   Target: 76 min  
   Difference: 29 min  
   Not approximately same.

6. idx_5  
   Response: 103 mins  
   Target: 96 min  
   Difference: 7 min  
   Possibly borderline, but difference greater than 5 min. Probably no.

Given this, an assumed tolerance of ±5 minutes would suffice as ""approximately the same"". Above that, score 0; within or equal to 5, score 1.

Re-evaluate with this:

- idx_0: 4 min difference → score 1  
- idx_1: 26 min difference → score 0  
- idx_2: 10 min difference → score 0  
- idx_3: exactly same → score 1  
- idx_4: 29 min difference → score 0
