While ""riverheadbooks"" is an imprint of Penguin Random House, and Random House is a big publisher, the target mentions ""Random House"" and ""John Murray,"" which are clearly two different publishers.

Even if riverheadbooks is connected within the Random House family, the response points explicitly to ""riverheadbooks"" only, which is not the same as the two publishers stated. Because the target explicitly points to two publishers, and the response only mentions one different imprint, they are not semantically the same.

Therefore, judged as not equivalent.
