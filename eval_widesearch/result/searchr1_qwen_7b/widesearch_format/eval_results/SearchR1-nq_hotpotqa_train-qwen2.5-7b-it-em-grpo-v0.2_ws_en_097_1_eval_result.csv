Criterion summary:  
- The response only needs to be approximately semantically the same as the target or point to the same entity.  
- No need for exact word-for-word matching.

---

**idx_0**  
- response: ""-""  
- target: ""-""  
Analysis: Both response and target are just ""-"", indicating no content in both. Semantically, they match (both empty). Thus, this is correct.

Score: 1

---

**idx_1**  
- response: ""-""  
- target: ""200053thcannesfilmfestivalbestactor,\n200120thhongkongfilmawardsbestactor\nthe1stchinesefilmmediaawardsbestactor""  
Analysis: Response is empty, target lists multiple awards. Since the response is empty, it does not demonstrate the same semantics or point to the same entities. Therefore, the response is incorrect.

Score: 0

- response: ""-""  
- target: ""thehongkongfilmdirectors’guildawards:bestactor\noutstandingactorawardatthe9thasianfilmexpo\nbestchineseactorawardatthe4thdoubanfilmawards""

- No need for exact word-for-word match.

---

### idx_0  
- Response: ""johnnieto""  
- Target: ""jinglema""  
Analysis:  
These two names refer to clearly different entities. ""johnnieto"" and ""jinglema"" are distinct names, with no semantic overlap or indication that they represent the same entity. Therefore, this is incorrect.

Score: 0

### idx_1  
- Response: ""wongkar-wai""  
- Target: ""karwaiwong""  
Analysis:  
The response is ""wongkar-wai"" and target is ""karwaiwong"". Although the position of first and last names are reversed and hyphenated differently, both clearly indicate the same person ""Kar-Wai Wong"" (a known filmmaker). Since the criterion accepts approximate semantics or pointing to the same entity, this counts as correct.
