Criterion summary:  
- Semantics approximately the same or pointing to the same entity is sufficient.  
- No need for word-for-word match.

---

### idx_0  
- Response: ""10horseguardsroad,stjames's,sw1y6bh""  
- Target: ""horseguards,whitehall,london,gb""  

Analysis:  
- The response includes “horseguardsroad” and “stjames's”  
- Target mentions “horseguards” and “whitehall” (both areas in London and close to each other geographically)  
- The response and target entities point to the same general location (Horse Guards Road/Whitehall area in London), although the street types and sub-areas differ.  
- According to the criterion, semantics approximately the same or pointing to same entity is enough.  
- This pair points to the same entity (Horse Guards area in London).  

Score: 1

### idx_1  
- Response: '1queensquare,londonwc1n3at'

### idx_2  
- Response: '100greenwichhighstreet,greenwich,se109hd'  
- Target: '12croomshill,greenwich,londonse108er'  

Analysis:

- Streets differ: response = Greenwich High Street; target = Croom's Hill

- So, they do not point to the same entity.
