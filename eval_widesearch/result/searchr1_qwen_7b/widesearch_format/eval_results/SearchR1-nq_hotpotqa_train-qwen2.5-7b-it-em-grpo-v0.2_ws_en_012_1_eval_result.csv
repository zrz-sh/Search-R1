---

**idx_0**  
- Response: founded a program to help underprivileged students succeed in school  
- Target: post-Katrina home rebuilding for low-income residents  

Analysis: The response focuses on helping underprivileged students with education success. The target is about rebuilding homes for low-income residents after a disaster. These are clearly different semantic domains (education vs. housing reconstruction). Therefore, not similar semantics or referring to the same entity.  

Score: 0

---

**idx_1**  
- Response: started a nonprofit that provides job training and employment opportunities  
- Target: “pushcart classroom” mobile schooling for street children  

Analysis: The response mentions job training and employment, while the target is about mobile schooling for street children. Both are related to helping disadvantaged youth, but job training and schooling are different activities. The response does not mention mobile schooling or street children specifically.  

The semantics are related but not approximately the same and do not point to the same entity/project. The criterion requires similar semantics or same entity. This is borderline but since the focus differs (job training vs. schooling), this counts as different.  

Score: 0

---

**idx_2**  
- Response: documented struggles of children affected by AIDS in Africa  
- Target: rescued+rehabilitated thousands (50,000+) of trafficking survivors  

Analysis: The response is about documentation of struggles of children with AIDS, the target is rescuing and rehabilitating trafficking survivors. While both mention children in hardship in Africa, documenting is very different from rescue and rehabilitation. They clearly point to different entities/efforts.  

Score: 0

---

**idx_3**  
- Response: provided medical care to women and children in developing countries  
- Target: free maternal & infant care in disaster- and poverty-stricken areas  

Analysis: Both mention medical care focused on women/maternal and children, with attention to vulnerable populations. While the response is more general (women and children in developing countries), the target is very specific (maternal and infant care in disaster/poverty areas). The semantics strongly overlap, both about medical care for women/children in difficult environments. The difference is minor and semantics are approximately the same.  

Score: 1

---

**idx_4**  
- Response: founded a nonprofit that supports women entrepreneurs in developing countries  
- Target: supports children living with incarcerated parents  

Analysis: The response is about supporting women entrepreneurs, the target about supporting children with incarcerated parents. Different beneficiaries and different purpose. Not approximately the same semantics.  

Score: 0

---

**idx_5**  
- Response: led a project that provided clean water to communities in rural India  
- Target: large-scale cleanup of U.S. rivers  

Analysis: Both mention water/environment, but the response is about providing clean water to rural communities in India; the target is about river cleanup on a large scale in the U.S. Different activities and locations, not same entity nor approximate semantics.  

Score: 0

---

**idx_6**  
- Response: founded a tech company that helped veterans transition to civilian life  
- Target: rescues animals from conflict zones & reunites with troops  

Analysis: Response is about veteran career transition; target is about animal rescue and reuniting with troops. Different activities/entities.

**idx_8**  
- Response: acted in films and used his platform to raise awareness about various causes  
- Target: temporary foster care for pets while owners enter addiction treatment

**idx_1**  
- Response: started a nonprofit that provides job training and employment opportunities  
- Target: “pushcart classroom” mobile schooling for street children  

Analysis: The response mentions job training and employment, while the target is about mobile schooling for street children. Both are related to helping disadvantaged youth, but job training and schooling are different activities. The response does not mention mobile schooling or street children specifically.  

The semantics are related but not approximately the same and do not point to the same entity/project. The criterion requires similar semantics or same entity. This is borderline but since the focus differs (job training vs. schooling), this counts as different.

**idx_0**  
- Response: founded a program to help underprivileged students succeed in school  
- Target: post-Katrina home rebuilding for low-income residents  

Analysis: The response focuses on helping underprivileged students with education success. The target is about rebuilding homes for low-income residents after a disaster. These are clearly different semantic domains (education vs. housing reconstruction). Therefore, not similar semantics or referring to the same entity.  

Score: 0

**idx_1**  
- Response: started a nonprofit that provides job training and employment opportunities  
- Target: “pushcart classroom” mobile schooling for street children  

Analysis: The response mentions job training and employment, while the target is about mobile schooling for street children. Both are related to helping disadvantaged youth, but job training and schooling are different activities. The response does not mention mobile schooling or street children specifically.  

The semantics are related but not approximately the same and do not point to the same entity/project. The criterion requires similar semantics or same entity. This is borderline but since the focus differs (job training vs. schooling), this counts as different.

**idx_0**  
- Response: founded a program to help underprivileged students succeed in school  
- Target: post-Katrina home rebuilding for low-income residents  

Analysis: The response focuses on helping underprivileged students with education success. The target is about rebuilding homes for low-income residents after a disaster. These are clearly different semantic domains (education vs. housing reconstruction). Therefore, not similar semantics or referring to the same entity.  

Score: 0

---

**idx_1**  
- Response: started a nonprofit that provides job training and employment opportunities  
- Target: “pushcart classroom” mobile schooling for street children  

Analysis: The response mentions job training and employment, while the target is about mobile schooling for street children. Both are related to helping disadvantaged youth, but job training and schooling are different activities. The response does not mention mobile schooling or street children specifically.  

The semantics are related but not approximately the same and do not point to the same entity/project. The criterion requires similar semantics or same entity. This is borderline but since the focus differs (job training vs. schooling), this counts as different.

Analysis: Both mention medical care focused on women/maternal and children, with attention to vulnerable populations. While the response is more general (women and children in developing countries), the target is very specific (maternal and infant care in disaster/poverty areas). The semantics strongly overlap, both about medical care for women/children in difficult environments. The difference is minor and semantics are approximately the same.

---

**idx_0**  
- Response: founded a program to help underprivileged students succeed in school  
- Target: post-Katrina home rebuilding for low-income residents  

Analysis: The response focuses on helping underprivileged students with education success. The target is about rebuilding homes for low-income residents after a disaster. These are clearly different semantic domains (education vs. housing reconstruction). Therefore, not similar semantics or referring to the same entity.  

Score: 0

---

**idx_1**  
- Response: started a nonprofit that provides job training and employment opportunities  
- Target: “pushcart classroom” mobile schooling for street children  

Analysis: The response mentions job training and employment, while the target is about mobile schooling for street children. Both are related to helping disadvantaged youth, but job training and schooling are different activities. The response does not mention mobile schooling or street children specifically.  

The semantics are related but not approximately the same and do not point to the same entity/project. The criterion requires similar semantics or same entity. This is borderline but since the focus differs (job training vs. schooling), this counts as different.  

Score: 0

---

**idx_2**  
- Response: documented struggles of children affected by AIDS in Africa  
- Target: rescued+rehabilitated thousands (50,000+) of trafficking survivors  

Analysis: The response is about documentation of struggles of children with AIDS, the target is rescuing and rehabilitating trafficking survivors. While both mention children in hardship in Africa, documenting is very different from rescue and rehabilitation. They clearly point to different entities/efforts.  

Score: 0

---

**idx_3**  
- Response: provided medical care to women and children in developing countries  
- Target: free maternal & infant care in disaster- and poverty-stricken areas  

Analysis: Both mention medical care focused on women/maternal and children, with attention to vulnerable populations. While the response is more general (women and children in developing countries), the target is very specific (maternal and infant care in disaster/poverty areas). The semantics strongly overlap, both about medical care for women/children in difficult environments. The difference is minor and semantics are approximately the same.  

Score: 1

---

**idx_4**  
- Response: founded a nonprofit that supports women entrepreneurs in developing countries  
- Target: supports children living with incarcerated parents  

Analysis: The response is about supporting women entrepreneurs, the target about supporting children with incarcerated parents. Different beneficiaries and different purpose. Not approximately the same semantics.  

Score: 0

---

**idx_5**  
- Response: led a project that provided clean water to communities in rural India  
- Target: large-scale cleanup of U.S. rivers  

Analysis: Both mention water/environment, but the response is about providing clean water to rural communities in India; the target is about river cleanup on a large scale in the U.S. Different activities and locations, not same entity nor approximate semantics.  

Score: 0

---

**idx_6**  
- Response: founded a tech company that helped veterans transition to civilian life  
- Target: rescues animals from conflict zones & reunites with troops  

Analysis: Response is about veteran career transition; target is about animal rescue and reuniting with troops. Different activities/entities.  

Score: 0

---

**idx_7**  
- Response: created a platform to help people connect with local artists and artisans  
- Target: Kopila Valley children’s home, school & women’s center  

Analysis: Response is about art and artisan connection platform; target is physical children’s home, school, women’s center — likely a humanitarian facility. Different semantic content.  

Score: 0

---

**idx_8**  
- Response: acted in films and used his platform to raise awareness about various causes  
- Target: temporary foster care for pets while owners enter addiction treatment  

Analysis: Response is about using celebrity platform and acting for awareness; target is a specific service of pet foster care related to addiction treatment. Different semantics, no overlap in meaning/entities.  

Score: 0

",temporaryfostercareforpetswhileownersenteraddictiontreatment,actedinfilmsandusedhisplatformtoraiseawarenessaboutvariouscauses,0.0,"Let's analyze the responses according to the provided criterion:

Criterion summary:
- It is enough if the evaluated answer roughly has the same meaning or points to the same entity/university as the reference answer.
- The answer only needs to mention the same university; details like the major do not have to match.
- Responses labeled ""nan"" (not a number or no answer) do not provide any content and thus cannot be considered matching any reference.
