,,1,1,1.0,"Let's analyze each pair of response and target according to the criterion:

Criterion:
- It is sufficient if the semantics are approximately the same or they point to the same entities.
- Individuals labeled as guest or comeback stage ones are not necessary.

Given that, the responses are all identical:  
""christinaaguilera,ceelogreen,adamlevine,blakeshelton""

For each target, we check if the response contains the same entities (regardless of order), or roughly the same group.

### idx_0
- Response: christinaaguilera,ceelogreen,adamlevine,blakeshelton
- Target: adamlevine,ceelogreen,christinaaguilera,blakeshelton
- Entities same, just different order → score = 1

- Response has ceelogreen, christinaaguilera which are not in target.
- Target has shakira, usher which are not in response.
- Common: adamlevine, blakeshelton only 2 out of 4 match.
- The response does not point to the same set of entities.
- According to criterion, semantics must be roughly the same or point to same entity group, which is not the case here.
- Score=0

### idx_4
- Target is the same as idx_0 type: adamlevine,ceelogreen,christinaaguilera,blakeshelton
- Response matches perfectly.

- Common entities: adamlevine, christinaaguilera, blakeshelton (3 out of 4)
- Response misses pharrellwilliams, instead includes ceelogreen.
- Since 3 out of 4 are the same and ceelogreen vs pharrellwilliams could be considered different entities (not synonyms), but the criterion allows approximate semantics or pointing to same entity, and the response majorly overlaps with target.
- Since majority match and no outright conflicting info, score=1

### idx_8

### Analysis:

**idx_0:**  
- Response: ""carsondaly""  
- Target: ""carsondaly,alisonhaislip(socialmedia)""  
- The response only includes ""carsondaly"" but the reference answer expects two entities. The response covers one entity but misses the second.

- Target has shakira, usher which are not in response.
- Common: adamlevine, blakeshelton only 2 out of 4 match.

- Common entities: adamlevine, christinaaguilera, blakeshelton (3 out of 4)
- Response misses pharrellwilliams, instead includes ceelogreen.
- Since 3 out of 4 are the same and ceelogreen vs pharrellwilliams could be considered different entities (not synonyms), but the criterion allows approximate semantics or pointing to same entity, and the response majorly overlaps with target.
- Since majority match and no outright conflicting info, score=1

Criterion:  
- The semantics are approximately the same as the reference answer or they point to the same entity.

### Analysis:

**idx_0:**  
- Response: ""carsondaly""  
- Target: ""carsondaly,alisonhaislip(socialmedia)""  
- The response only includes ""carsondaly"" but the reference answer expects two entities. The response covers one entity but misses the second. Since the criterion says semantics are approximately the same or pointing to the same entity is sufficient, the response correctly points to ""carsondaly,"" which is part of the target. It's acceptable to have only one entity if it points to an entity in the target.  
- So: score = 1

**idx_1:**  
- Response: ""carsondaly""  
- Target: ""carsondaly,christinamilian(socialmedia)""  
- Same as above: response points to one of the entities in the target answer.  
- score = 1

**idx_2:**  
- Same as idx_1  
- score = 1

**idx_3:**  
- Same as idx_1

- Response has ceelogreen, christinaaguilera which are not in target.
- Target has shakira, usher which are not in response.
- Common: adamlevine, blakeshelton only 2 out of 4 match.
- The response does not point to the same set of entities.
- According to criterion, semantics must be roughly the same or point to same entity group, which is not the case here.
- Score=0

### idx_4
- Target is the same as idx_0 type: adamlevine,ceelogreen,christinaaguilera,blakeshelton
- Response matches perfectly.

- Response: christinaaguilera,ceelogreen,adamlevine,blakeshelton
- Common entities: adamlevine, christinaaguilera, blakeshelton (3 out of 4)
- Response misses pharrellwilliams, instead includes ceelogreen.
- Since 3 out of 4 are the same and ceelogreen vs pharrellwilliams could be considered different entities (not synonyms), but the criterion allows approximate semantics or pointing to same entity, and the response majorly overlaps with target.
- Since majority match and no outright conflicting info, score=1

### idx_8
- Target: adamlevine,gwenstefani,pharrellwilliams,blakeshelton
- Response: christinaaguilera,ceelogreen,adamlevine,blakeshelton

### Analysis:

**idx_0:**

- Target: ""carsondaly,alisonhaislip(socialmedia)""  
- The response only includes ""carsondaly"" but the reference answer expects two entities. The response covers one entity but misses the second.

- No need for word-for-word match.

Now, let's check each idx:

Criterion:  
- The semantics are approximately the same as the reference answer or they point to the same entity.  
- No need for word-for-word correspondence.

### Analysis:

**idx_0:**  
- Response: ""carsondaly""  
- Target: ""carsondaly,alisonhaislip(socialmedia)""  
- The response only includes ""carsondaly"" but the reference answer expects two entities. The response covers one entity but misses the second. Since the criterion says semantics are approximately the same or pointing to the same entity is sufficient, the response correctly points to ""carsondaly,"" which is part of the target. It's acceptable to have only one entity if it points to an entity in the target.  
- So: score = 1

**idx_1:**  
- Response: ""carsondaly""  
- Target: ""carsondaly,christinamilian(socialmedia)""  
- Same as above: response points to one of the entities in the target answer.  
- score = 1

**idx_2:**  
- Same as idx_1  
- score = 1

**idx_3:**  
- Same as idx_1  
- score = 1

**idx_4:**

- Target: ""carsondaly""  
- Exact entity match.

Criterion summary:  
- The response and the target answer should be semantically approximately the same or point to the same entity.  
- Word-for-word matching is not necessary.  
- Since all responses are ""nan"" while targets are specified non-""nan"" entities in some cases, semantic equivalence or pointing to the same entity will not be satisfied if the response is ""nan"" and the target is meaningful.

Items:

- idx_0 to idx_4: response = ""nan"", target = ""nan""

### Analysis:

**idx_0:**  
- Response: ""carsondaly""  
- Target: ""carsondaly,alisonhaislip(socialmedia)""  
- The response only includes ""carsondaly"" but the reference answer expects two entities. The response covers one entity but misses the second. Since the criterion says semantics are approximately the same or pointing to the same entity is sufficient, the response correctly points to ""carsondaly,"" which is part of the target. It's acceptable to have only one entity if it points to an entity in the target.  
- So: score = 1

### Summary:  
None of the responses matches any/all of the songs in the references for the corresponding idx. The criterion requires all songs from the target to be included if multiple are given.

Thus, all scores are zero.

- Response has ceelogreen, christinaaguilera which are not in target.
- Target has shakira, usher which are not in response.
- Common: adamlevine, blakeshelton only 2 out of 4 match.
- The response does not point to the same set of entities.
- According to criterion, semantics must be roughly the same or point to same entity group, which is not the case here.

### idx_6
- Target: adamlevine,gwenstefani,pharrellwilliams,blakeshelton
- Response: christinaaguilera,ceelogreen,adamlevine,blakeshelton
- Common: adamlevine, blakeshelton
- Response misses gwenstefani, pharrellwilliams, includes ceelogreen and christinaaguilera which target does not have.
- Not pointing to same entity set.
- Score=0

### idx_7
- Target: adamlevine,pharrellwilliams,christinaaguilera,blakeshelton
- Response: christinaaguilera,ceelogreen,adamlevine,blakeshelton
- Common entities: adamlevine, christinaaguilera, blakeshelton (3 out of 4)
- Response misses pharrellwilliams, instead includes ceelogreen.
- Since 3 out of 4 are the same and ceelogreen vs pharrellwilliams could be considered different entities (not synonyms), but the criterion allows approximate semantics or pointing to same entity, and the response majorly overlaps with target.
- Since majority match and no outright conflicting info, score=1

Criterion:  
- The semantics are approximately the same as the reference answer or they point to the same entity.  
- No need for word-for-word correspondence.

### Analysis:

**idx_0:**  
- Response: ""carsondaly""  
- Target: ""carsondaly,alisonhaislip(socialmedia)""  
- The response only includes ""carsondaly"" but the reference answer expects two entities. The response covers one entity but misses the second. Since the criterion says semantics are approximately the same or pointing to the same entity is sufficient, the response correctly points to ""carsondaly,"" which is part of the target. It's acceptable to have only one entity if it points to an entity in the target.  
- So: score = 1

**idx_1:**  
- Response: ""carsondaly""  
- Target: ""carsondaly,christinamilian(socialmedia)""  
- Same as above: response points to one of the entities in the target answer.  
- score = 1

**idx_2:**  
- Same as idx_1  
- score = 1

**idx_3:**  
- Same as idx_1  
- score = 1

**idx_4:**  
- Response: ""carsondaly""  
- Target: ""carsondaly""  
- Exact entity match.

Criterion summary:  
- The response and the target answer should be semantically approximately the same or point to the same entity.  
- Word-for-word matching is not necessary.  
- Since all responses are ""nan"" while targets are specified non-""nan"" entities in some cases, semantic equivalence or pointing to the same entity will not be satisfied if the response is ""nan"" and the target is meaningful.

Items:

- idx_0 to idx_4: response = ""nan"", target = ""nan""  
  Here both response and target are ""nan"", they match perfectly in semantics (both are ""nan""). So these should get score = 1.

**idx_0:**

- Target: ""carsondaly,alisonhaislip(socialmedia)""  
- The response only includes ""carsondaly"" but the reference answer expects two entities. The response covers one entity but misses the second.

### Summary:  
None of the responses matches any/all of the songs in the references for the corresponding idx. The criterion requires all songs from the target to be included if multiple are given.

Thus, all scores are zero.

- Response has ceelogreen, christinaaguilera which are not in target.
- Target has shakira, usher which are not in response.
- Common: adamlevine, blakeshelton only 2 out of 4 match.
- The response does not point to the same set of entities.

- Response: christinaaguilera,ceelogreen,adamlevine,blakeshelton
- Common entities: adamlevine, christinaaguilera, blakeshelton (3 out of 4)
- Response misses pharrellwilliams, instead includes ceelogreen.
- Since 3 out of 4 are the same and ceelogreen vs pharrellwilliams could be considered different entities (not synonyms), but the criterion allows approximate semantics or pointing to same entity, and the response majorly overlaps with target.
- Since majority match and no outright conflicting info, score=1

### Summary:  
None of the responses matches any/all of the songs in the references for the corresponding idx. The criterion requires all songs from the target to be included if multiple are given.

Thus, all scores are zero.

### Analysis:

**idx_0:**  
- Response: ""carsondaly""  
- Target: ""carsondaly,alisonhaislip(socialmedia)""  
- The response only includes ""carsondaly"" but the reference answer expects two entities. The response covers one entity but misses the second. Since the criterion says semantics are approximately the same or pointing to the same entity is sufficient, the response correctly points to ""carsondaly,"" which is part of the target. It's acceptable to have only one entity if it points to an entity in the target.  
- So: score = 1

**idx_1:**

Criterion summary:  
- The response and the target answer should be semantically approximately the same or point to the same entity.  
- Word-for-word matching is not necessary.  
- Since all responses are ""nan"" while targets are specified non-""nan"" entities in some cases, semantic equivalence or pointing to the same entity will not be satisfied if the response is ""nan"" and the target is meaningful.

Items:

- idx_0 to idx_4: response = ""nan"", target = ""nan""  
  Here both response and target are ""nan"", they match perfectly in semantics (both are ""nan""). So these should get score = 1.

```",carsondaly,carsondaly,0.0,"Let's analyze each idx item one by one according to the criterion:

Criterion summary:  
- The response and the target answer should be semantically approximately the same or point to the same entity.  
- Word-for-word matching is not necessary.  
- Since all responses are ""nan"" while targets are specified non-""nan"" entities in some cases, semantic equivalence or pointing to the same entity will not be satisfied if the response is ""nan"" and the target is meaningful.

---

Items:

- idx_0 to idx_4: response = ""nan"", target = ""nan""  
  Here both response and target are ""nan"", they match perfectly in semantics (both are ""nan""). So these should get score = 1.

- idx_5: response = ""nan"", target = ""chrismartin""  
  Different entities, response is ""nan"" no semantic info, target is a specific entity ""chrismartin"". Not matching. Score = 0.

- idx_6: response = ""nan"", target = ""taylorswift""  
  Same reasoning as above. Score = 0.

- idx_7: response = ""nan"", target = ""nateruess""  
  Score = 0.

- idx_8: response = ""nan"", target = ""rihanna""  
  Score = 0.

- idx_9: response = ""nan"", target = ""mileycyrus""  
  Score = 0.

- idx_10: response = ""nan"", target = ""timmcgraw,faithhill""  
  Target is a pair of entities, response is ""nan"". No match. Score = 0.

- idx_11: response = ""nan"", target = ""shaniatwain""  
  Score = 0.

- idx_12: response = ""nan"", target = ""kellyclarkson""

The criterion states:  
- It is sufficient if the semantics are approximately the same or if they point to the same entity.  
- No need for word-for-word match.

Now, let's check each idx:

- idx_0: response = ""thevoice"", target = ""timeaftertime""  
  These are two different song titles/entities. Not the same or semantically equivalent. Score = 0

- idx_1: response = ""i'myours"", target = ""complicated""  
  Different songs. Score = 0

- idx_2: response = ""ifiain'tgotyou"", target = ""torn""  
  Different songs. Score = 0

- idx_3: response = ""alliwant"", target = ""mean""  
  Different songs. Score = 0

- idx_4: response = ""alliwant"", target = ""try""  
  Different songs. Score = 0

- idx_5: response = ""alliwant"", target = ""onemoretry""
