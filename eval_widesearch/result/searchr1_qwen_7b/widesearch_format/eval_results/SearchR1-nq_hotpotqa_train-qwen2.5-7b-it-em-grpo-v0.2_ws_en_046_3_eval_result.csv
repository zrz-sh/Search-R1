- **Response:** ""-"" (no response)

**Analysis:**  
Response provides no information (""-""), while target expects a list of names. Not approximately the same, no matching entity.  
**Score:** 0

- **Response:** ""-"" (no response)

**Analysis:**  
Same as idx_0, no response vs a list of names.  
No semantic similarity or entity matching at all.  
**Score:** 0

**Analysis:**  
- Target and response both include ""lindseyberg"" and ""nicoledavis"".  
- Other names are mostly different, but 2 of the names match, meaning the response partially overlaps entities.  
- Criterion says ""sufficient if semantics approximately same or pointing to the same entity""  
- In this case, only two names match out of many.  
- The response includes many other names not in the target, and does not cover most of the target names, but the presence of matching entities suggests partial correctness.

The criterion does not explicitly say we need full matching, but ""approximately the same"" implies more coverage or at least a clear pointing to the same entities collectively.

Because the overlap is small (2/12), the response is not approximately matching the target entity set. It is more of a mismatch.

Given the criterion is quite lenient (""approximately same or pointing to the same entity""), a low intersection is borderline.

But since only 2 common entities are present and most entities differ, likely the answer is considered not correct.
