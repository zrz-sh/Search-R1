### idx_0
- **Response:** ""158-11daehak-ro5-gil,jongno-gu,seoul""
- **Target:** ""37samcheong-ro,jongnodistrict,seoul""
- **Analysis:**  
  The addresses differ in the street name and the number: ""daehak-ro5-gil"" vs. ""samcheong-ro"" and the numbers are different as well. The district is similar (""jongno-gu"" vs ""jongnodistrict""), and city is same (""seoul""). However, the criterion requires the semantics to be approximately the same or pointing to the same entity.   
  Here, the streets and numbers differ significantly, so this is not the same location or equivalent entity. Therefore, **score = 0**.

---

### idx_1
- **Response:** ""20cheongnyangni-ro5-gil,gangnam-gu,seoul""
- **Target:** ""55saemunan-ro,jongnodistrict,seoul""
- **Analysis:**  
  The streets (""cheongnyangni-ro5-gil"" vs ""saemunan-ro"") differ entirely, as do the numbers (20 vs 55), and the districts are different (""gangnam-gu"" vs ""jongnodistrict""). Although both are districts of Seoul, they represent different areas. Not pointing to the same entity or approximate location.  
  **Score = 0**.

---

### idx_2
- **Response:** ""122gwahang-ro2-gil,gangnam-gu,seoul""
- **Target:** ""30samcheong-ro,jongnodistrict,seoul""
- **Analysis:**  
  Differ in street name (""gwahang-ro2-gil"" vs ""samcheong-ro""), number (122 vs 30), and district (""gangnam-gu"" vs ""jongnodistrict""). Not the same entity or approximately identical.  
  **Score = 0**.

### idx_0
- **Target:** ""march to october: 09:00-18:00\n※saturday:09:00-20:00""
- **Response:** ""10:00-18:00""

**Analysis:**
- The target states opening hours from 9:00 to 18:00 during March to October, and Saturdays until 20:00.
- Response gives 10:00-18:00.
- The criterion says closure dates are not necessary. However, the response's time range differs in the opening time (10:00 vs 09:00).
- Since the response lists 10:00-18:00 (an hour later start), the semantics differ because the opening time is shifted and the Saturday extended time is omitted.
- The response does not mention the extended hours for Saturday, nor that this schedule is valid March to October.
- Closure date omission is acceptable, but time range is different. Semantics are not approximately the same.

**Verdict:** Score = 0

---

### idx_1
- **Target:** ""weekdays/weekends: 09:00–18:00 (admission stops at 17:30)\nevery friday: extended hours from 18:00 to 21:00\nrest days: January 1st and every Monday""
- **Response:** ""10:00-18:00""

**Analysis:**
- Target's base hours are 09:00-18:00 daily, with some variations.
- Response shows 10:00-18:00, one hour later start.
- Omits admission stop time and closed days, which is acceptable.
- However, the start time is different; semantics differ significantly.
- The criterion states it must be approximately the same semantics or point to the same entity.
- The response's times conflict with the target opening time.

**Verdict:** Score = 0

---

### idx_2
- **Target:** ""mon/tue/thu/fri/sun 10:00-18:00; wed/sat 10:00-21:00""
- **Response:** ""10:00-18:00""

**Analysis:**
- Target shows a split: 10:00-18:00 on most days; 10:00-21:00 on Wed and Sat.
- Response gives a general 10:00-18:00.
- Semantically, since the response matches the majority opening times, and does not contradict them.
- The criterion allows approximate semantics.
- Not mentioning the extended hours on Wed/Sat is acceptable (no closure dates needed, similarly extended hours can be omitted).
- Thus, response and target essentially point to the same core hours.

**Verdict:** Score = 1
