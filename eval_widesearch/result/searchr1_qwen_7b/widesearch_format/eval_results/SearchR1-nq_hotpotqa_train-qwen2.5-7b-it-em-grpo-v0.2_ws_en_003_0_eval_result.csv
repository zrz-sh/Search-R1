  The response is ""olympic"" (singular adjective or noun), target is ""olympics"" (plural noun). Semantically, both refer to the Olympic Games. The singular adjective ""olympic"" can be taken as a reference to the event or related concept. Given the criterion that approximate semantics or pointing to the same entity is sufficient, this answer is acceptable.
