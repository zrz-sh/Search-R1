### General Analysis of the Criterion
- The response needs to have approximately the same semantics as the standard answer or point to the same entity.
- Word-for-word correspondence is not necessary.
- The standard answers list a range of shutter speeds (e.g., 1/8000 to 30s), mention fine-tune details (about 1/3 or 1/2 EV steps), bulb and remote bulb modes, and sometimes x200 or extendable times.

**Target:** ""1/8000−30s(fine-tunewith1/3or1/2ev;extendableto900sinmmode),bulb,remotebulb,x200""

- The response mentions the range 30sec to 1/8000sec. This matches the range shown in the target from 1/8000 to 30s.
- The target also includes complicated details: fine tuning steps, extendable to 900s in mm mode, bulb, remote bulb, x200.
- The response only mentions the shutter speed range but none of the other details.
- According to the criterion, the semantics need to be approximately the same or point to the same entity.
- The shutter speed range is a core part of the answer, so capturing it could be sufficient.
- However, the additional modes (bulb/remotebulb) and fine tuning details are missing.
- Does the response miss enough information to warrant a 0? The criterion says approximate or pointing to same entity is sufficient.
- Since the response captures the entire range of shutter speeds, which is the main key info, and the rest are details, this seems acceptable.

**Score:** 1

### idx_1

**Response:** ""30sec-1/8000sec""  
**Target:** ""1/8000−30s(fine-tunewith1/3or1/2ev;extendableto900sinmmode),bulb,remotebulb,x200""

### idx_2

**Response:** ""30sec-1/8000sec""  
**Target:** ""1/4000−30s(fine-tunewith1/3or1/2ev),bulb,remotebulb""

- The target shutter speed range is 1/4000 to 30s.
- The response states 30sec-1/8000sec.
- Response gives a broader range (up to 1/8000s) than the target (up to 1/4000s).
- The response range is not exactly the same but includes all speeds in the target and beyond.
- The response misses the mention of fine-tuning and bulb modes.
- However, the criterion states semantics approximately same or pointing to same entity is sufficient.
- The main core is shutter speed range.
- The response shows the shutter speed range as 30sec-1/8000sec, which includes the entire target range.
- So the main info is captured and the response points to the same entity.

- Response: ""100-51200""

Analysis:
- The response removes ""iso"" but retains the full exact numeric range.
- Semantics remain the same (the ISO range).
- Points to the same entity.

Score: 1

---

### idx_2
- Target: ""iso100-51200""  
- Response: ""100-51200""

Analysis:
- Same as idx_1.
- Semantic equivalence is maintained.

Score: 1

### General Analysis of the Criterion
- The response needs to have approximately the same semantics as the standard answer or point to the same entity.
- Word-for-word correspondence is not necessary.
- The standard answers list a range of shutter speeds (e.g., 1/8000 to 30s), mention fine-tune details (about 1/3 or 1/2 EV steps), bulb and remote bulb modes, and sometimes x200 or extendable times.

### idx_0

**Response:** ""30sec-1/8000sec""  
**Target:** ""1/8000−30s(fine-tunewith1/3or1/2ev;extendableto900sinmmode),bulb,remotebulb,x200""

- The response mentions the range 30sec to 1/8000sec. This matches the range shown in the target from 1/8000 to 30s.
- The target also includes complicated details: fine tuning steps, extendable to 900s in mm mode, bulb, remote bulb, x200.
- The response only mentions the shutter speed range but none of the other details.
- According to the criterion, the semantics need to be approximately the same or point to the same entity.
- The shutter speed range is a core part of the answer, so capturing it could be sufficient.
- However, the additional modes (bulb/remotebulb) and fine tuning details are missing.
- Does the response miss enough information to warrant a 0? The criterion says approximate or pointing to same entity is sufficient.
- Since the response captures the entire range of shutter speeds, which is the main key info, and the rest are details, this seems acceptable.

**Score:** 1

### idx_1

**Response:** ""30sec-1/8000sec""  
**Target:** ""1/8000−30s(fine-tunewith1/3or1/2ev;extendableto900sinmmode),bulb,remotebulb,x200""

- Identical to idx_0, same analysis applies.

**Score:** 1

---

### idx_2

**Response:** ""30sec-1/8000sec""  
**Target:** ""1/4000−30s(fine-tunewith1/3or1/2ev),bulb,remotebulb""

- The target shutter speed range is 1/4000 to 30s.
- The response states 30sec-1/8000sec.
- Response gives a broader range (up to 1/8000s) than the target (up to 1/4000s).
- The response range is not exactly the same but includes all speeds in the target and beyond.
- The response misses the mention of fine-tuning and bulb modes.
- However, the criterion states semantics approximately same or pointing to same entity is sufficient.
- The main core is shutter speed range.
- The response shows the shutter speed range as 30sec-1/8000sec, which includes the entire target range.
- So the main info is captured and the response points to the same entity.
- Thus, score 1.
