Criterion:  
It is sufficient if the semantics are approximately the same as the reference answer or if they point to the same entity. No need for exact word-for-word match.

1. idx_0: response ""cgon"" vs target ""cgon""  
- Exact match. Semantics are identical.  
- Score = 1

2. idx_1: response ""zbio"" vs target ""zbio""  
- Exact match.
