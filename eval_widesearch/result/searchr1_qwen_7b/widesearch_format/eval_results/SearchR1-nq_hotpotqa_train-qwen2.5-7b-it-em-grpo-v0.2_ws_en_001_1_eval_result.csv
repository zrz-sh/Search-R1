,,engineering&technology,Engineering and Technology,massachusettsinstituteoftechnology,Massachusetts Institute of Technology,0.0,"Let's analyze each pair step by step according to the criteria:

Criterion:  
- Semantics must be approximately the same or point to the same entity.  
- Month and day must be correct.  
- Score is 1 if correct, 0 if incorrect.

Since all responses are ""nan"" (not a date or similar value), and all targets specify a particular date (some including time), none of the responses match the targets. Therefore, each response should be assigned a score of 0.

Detailed analysis:

- idx_0: response ""nan"" vs target ""january6"" → no match → 0

### Provided information:

- Each item has an index, a **response**, and a **target** (standard answer).
- The **response** for all items is `'nan'`.
- The **target** varies and includes single fees like `$75`, `$90`, `£60`, `$85`, `$70` or multiple fees like:
  ```

  ```
- Grading criteria:
  - Score is either 0 or 1.
  - If semantics are approximately the same or point to the same entity, score 1.
  - If multiple fees in the reference, all must be included.
  - ""nan"" is not a number, so likely means ""no answer"" or an invalid / empty response.
  
### Step-by-step analysis per index:

- Response is `'nan'` for **all** indexes.
- Since `'nan'` is clearly not equivalent or even approximately the same as any target values that are dollar or pound amounts or fee descriptions, the response fails to meet the criteria.
- Because all responses are empty or invalid (nan), none can be considered correct even partially.
- For entries that require multiple fees to be stated, this is even stricter; partial or missing fees would mean score 0.
- Thus, all responses get a score of 0.

### Provided information:

- Each item has an index, a **response**, and a **target** (standard answer).
- The **response** for all items is `'nan'`.
- The **target** varies and includes single fees like `$75`, `$90`, `£60`, `$85`, `$70` or multiple fees like:
  ```

- Grading criteria:
  - Score is either 0 or 1.
  - If semantics are approximately the same or point to the same entity, score 1.
  - If multiple fees in the reference, all must be included.
  - ""nan"" is not a number, so likely means ""no answer"" or an invalid / empty response.
  
### Step-by-step analysis per index:

- Response is `'nan'` for **all** indexes.
- Since `'nan'` is clearly not equivalent or even approximately the same as any target values that are dollar or pound amounts or fee descriptions, the response fails to meet the criteria.
- Because all responses are empty or invalid (nan), none can be considered correct even partially.
- For entries that require multiple fees to be stated, this is even stricter; partial or missing fees would mean score 0.
- Thus, all responses get a score of 0.

,,socialsciences&management,Social Sciences,stanforduniversity,Stanford University,0.0,"Let's analyze each pair step by step according to the criteria:

Criterion:  
- Semantics must be approximately the same or point to the same entity.  
- Month and day must be correct.  
- Score is 1 if correct, 0 if incorrect.

Since all responses are ""nan"" (not a date or similar value), and all targets specify a particular date (some including time), none of the responses match the targets. Therefore, each response should be assigned a score of 0.

Detailed analysis:

- idx_0: response ""nan"" vs target ""january6"" → no match → 0  
- idx_1: ""nan"" vs ""october15,6pm(bst)"" → no match → 0  
- idx_2: ""nan"" vs ""january5"" → no match → 0  
- idx_3: ""nan"" vs ""oct15"" → no match → 0  
- idx_4: ""nan"" vs ""january1"" → no match → 0  
- idx_5: ""nan"" vs ""october15,6pm(bst)"" → no match → 0  
- idx_6: ""nan"" vs ""january2,2025"" → no match → 0  
- idx_7: ""nan"" vs ""january6"" → no match → 0  
- idx_8: ""nan"" vs ""october15,6pm(bst)"" → no match → 0

- idx_11: ""nan"" vs ""october15,6pm(bst)"" → no match → 0

",january5,nan,0.0,"First, let's analyze the provided data and grading criteria step by step.

### Provided information:

- Each item has an index, a **response**, and a **target** (standard answer).
- The **response** for all items is `'nan'`.
- The **target** varies and includes single fees like `$75`, `$90`, `£60`, `$85`, `$70` or multiple fees like:
  ```
  taughtcoursesis£75:
  researchcoursesis£20
  ```
- Grading criteria:
  - Score is either 0 or 1.
  - If semantics are approximately the same or point to the same entity, score 1.
  - If multiple fees in the reference, all must be included.
  - ""nan"" is not a number, so likely means ""no answer"" or an invalid / empty response.
  
### Step-by-step analysis per index:

- Response is `'nan'` for **all** indexes.
- Since `'nan'` is clearly not equivalent or even approximately the same as any target values that are dollar or pound amounts or fee descriptions, the response fails to meet the criteria.
- Because all responses are empty or invalid (nan), none can be considered correct even partially.
- For entries that require multiple fees to be stated, this is even stricter; partial or missing fees would mean score 0.
- Thus, all responses get a score of 0.
