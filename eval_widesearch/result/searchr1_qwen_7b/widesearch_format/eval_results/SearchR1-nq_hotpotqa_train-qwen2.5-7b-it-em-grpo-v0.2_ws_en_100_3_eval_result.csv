- Judge vs Chief judge of the same court — roughly the same entity (chief judge is a special role but still a judge of the same court). Since the reference specifically says chief judge, question is if ""judge"" alone suffices. The criterion says approximately same semantics or pointing to the same entity. Here ""judge"" is less specific than ""chief judge"" — but the entity is still the same (the court, and a judge). Usually, chief judge is a distinguished position, so not identical to just judge. Given the criterion is approximate or same entity: both refer to a judge on the 1st Circuit Court of Appeals. I think it's acceptable here to consider it correct (1).

Here ""judge"" is less specific than ""chief judge"" — but the entity is still the same (the court, and a judge). Usually, chief judge is a distinguished position, so not identical to just judge.

Since the reference specifically says chief judge, question is if ""judge"" alone suffices. The criterion says approximately same semantics or pointing to the same entity. Here ""judge"" is less specific than ""chief judge"" — but the entity is still the same (the court, and a judge). Usually, chief judge is a distinguished position, so not identical to just judge. Given the criterion is approximate or same entity: both refer to a judge on the 1st Circuit Court of Appeals. I think it's acceptable here to consider it correct (1).

- Judge vs Chief judge of the same court — roughly the same entity (chief judge is a special role but still a judge of the same court). Since the reference specifically says chief judge, question is if ""judge"" alone suffices. The criterion says approximately same semantics or pointing to the same entity. Here ""judge"" is less specific than ""chief judge"" — but the entity is still the same (the court, and a judge). Usually, chief judge is a distinguished position, so not identical to just judge. Given the criterion is approximate or same entity: both refer to a judge on the 1st Circuit Court of Appeals. I think it's acceptable here to consider it correct (1).

- Judge vs Chief judge of the same court — roughly the same entity (chief judge is a special role but still a judge of the same court). Since the reference specifically says chief judge, question is if ""judge"" alone suffices. The criterion says approximately same semantics or pointing to the same entity. Here ""judge"" is less specific than ""chief judge"" — but the entity is still the same (the court, and a judge). Usually, chief judge is a distinguished position, so not identical to just judge. Given the criterion is approximate or same entity: both refer to a judge on the 1st Circuit Court of Appeals. I think it's acceptable here to consider it correct (1).

- Judge vs Chief judge of the same court — roughly the same entity (chief judge is a special role but still a judge of the same court). Since the reference specifically says chief judge, question is if ""judge"" alone suffices. The criterion says approximately same semantics or pointing to the same entity. Here ""judge"" is less specific than ""chief judge"" — but the entity is still the same (the court, and a judge). Usually, chief judge is a distinguished position, so not identical to just judge. Given the criterion is approximate or same entity: both refer to a judge on the 1st Circuit Court of Appeals. I think it's acceptable here to consider it correct (1).

- Target: chiefjudge,u.s.courtofappeals(1stcircuit)  
- Judge vs Chief judge of the same court — roughly the same entity (chief judge is a special role but still a judge of the same court). Since the reference specifically says chief judge, question is if ""judge"" alone suffices. The criterion says approximately same semantics or pointing to the same entity. Here ""judge"" is less specific than ""chief judge"" — but the entity is still the same (the court, and a judge). Usually, chief judge is a distinguished position, so not identical to just judge. Given the criterion is approximate or same entity: both refer to a judge on the 1st Circuit Court of Appeals. I think it's acceptable here to consider it correct (1).
