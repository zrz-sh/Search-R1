- Criterion: ""It is sufficient if the semantics are approximately the same as the reference answer or if they point to the same entity.""
- The responses must match the target in meaning or entity, no need for an exact word match.
- Each pair's response and target are identical strings (e.g., ""richardnixon"" vs ""richardnixon""), so all responses exactly match the targets.

Item-by-item analysis:

- idx_0: response = ""richardnixon"", target = ""richardnixon"" → identical → score 1
