**idx_0**  
Response: ""french""  
Target: ""refined french classic with modern techniques""  
Analysis: The target describes a refined French classic cuisine with modern techniques. The response simply states ""french,"" which is more general but still points to the same culinary origin/entity. Since ""french"" covers ""refined french classic with modern techniques,"" it is semantically sufficient.  
Score: 1

Response: ""french""  
Target: ""vegetable-forward, garden-inspired french""  
Analysis: The target emphasizes a vegetable-forward, garden-inspired style within French cuisine. The response is simply ""french,"" which is more general but includes this style implicitly. The key entity (French cuisine) matches, so this is sufficient.
