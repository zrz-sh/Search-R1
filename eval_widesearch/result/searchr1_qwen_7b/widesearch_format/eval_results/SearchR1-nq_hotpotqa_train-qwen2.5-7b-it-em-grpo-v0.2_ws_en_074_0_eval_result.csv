Semantic equivalence check: ""CDU/CSU"" is the commonly used abbreviation for ""Christian Democratic Union"" and ""Christian Social Union"" in Germany. Since the target is ""christiandemocraticunion"" (without mentioning CSU), and the response includes ""CDU/CSU"" (which encompasses CDU), this can be taken as pointing to the same main entity. According to the criterion, approximate same semantics or pointing to the same entity is sufficient. Score: 1
