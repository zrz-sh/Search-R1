- Background/occupation expressions should be approximately similar.  
- No need for exact wording.

### idx_0  
- Target: ""chemicalengineer&inventor""  
- Response: ""innovator""  
Analysis:  
- ""Inventor"" is quite close in meaning to ""innovator,"" both implying creation/discovery.  
- ""Chemical engineer"" is more specific but ""innovator"" is more general and still in related semantic space regarding creativity and invention.  
- Since ""innovator"" does encompass the inventor role and the criterion allows approximate background/occupation expressions, this is sufficient.  

Score: 1

### idx_1  
- Target: ""thefounderofthenon-profitbeauty2thestreetz""  
- Response: ""socialworker""  
Analysis:  
- The target is a founder of a specific nonprofit. The response is ""socialworker.""  
- A social worker is a profession concerned with helping people; a founder is a role of creating an organization.  
- Being the founder of a nonprofit may imply social/contributive work, but ""socialworker"" and ""founder of a nonprofit"" are not exactly the same semantic roles.  
- The criterion says approximate expressions are okay if meaning is similar; here, founding a nonprofit is more specific than just being a social worker. But ""socialworker"" is not an unreasonable simplification; both imply engagement in social causes.  
- However, ""socialworker"" identifies a profession, while ""founder"" identifies organizational leadership.  
- The target is quite specific (founder of a specific nonprofit), while ""socialworker"" is quite general.  
- It is borderline, but since it's a close semantic field (social cause, nonprofit), and the criterion allows approximate expressions, this can be accepted as approximately the same.  

Score: 1

### idx_2  
- Target: ""techentrepreneur;foundertechlitafrica""  
- Response: ""socialentrepreneur""  
Analysis:  
- Target: tech entrepreneur and founder of a tech-related organization.  
- Response: social entrepreneur.  
- Both entail entrepreneurship and starting organizations aiming at impact, though slightly different sectors.  
- ""Tech entrepreneur"" is specific to technology; ""social entrepreneur"" emphasizes social impact.  
- Founding a social tech org could mean the two are very close semantically.  
- The criterion states approximate expression of background/occupation is sufficient.  
- Since the core meaning (founder/entrepreneur with impact) is shared, this is acceptable.  

Score: 1

### idx_3  
- Target: ""veterinarian;founderprojectstreetvet""  
- Response: ""psychiatrist""  
Analysis:  
- Target is a vet and founder of a project for animal care.  
- Response says psychiatrist, which is a medical field but focused on humans' mental health, completely different from vet.  
- No overlap in domain or role here.  
- The meanings do NOT approximate each other or point to the same entity.  
- Not acceptable.  

Score: 0

- Response: ""founder,dogsmatter""  
Analysis:  
- Target: nonprofit executive and founder of Dogs Matter.  
- Response: founder of Dogs Matter.  
- Response captures the key entity (""founder of Dogs Matter"") and is semantically equivalent.  
- Omitting ""non-profit exec"" is acceptable as per criterion (approximate background).

- Background/occupation expressions should be approximately similar.  
- No need for exact wording.

### idx_0  
- Target: ""chemicalengineer&inventor""  
- Response: ""innovator""  
Analysis:  
- ""Inventor"" is quite close in meaning to ""innovator,"" both implying creation/discovery.  
- ""Chemical engineer"" is more specific but ""innovator"" is more general and still in related semantic space regarding creativity and invention.  
- Since ""innovator"" does encompass the inventor role and the criterion allows approximate background/occupation expressions, this is sufficient.  

Score: 1

### idx_1  
- Target: ""thefounderofthenon-profitbeauty2thestreetz""  
- Response: ""socialworker""  
Analysis:  
- The target is a founder of a specific nonprofit. The response is ""socialworker.""  
- A social worker is a profession concerned with helping people; a founder is a role of creating an organization.  
- Being the founder of a nonprofit may imply social/contributive work, but ""socialworker"" and ""founder of a nonprofit"" are not exactly the same semantic roles.  
- The criterion says approximate expressions are okay if meaning is similar; here, founding a nonprofit is more specific than just being a social worker. But ""socialworker"" is not an unreasonable simplification; both imply engagement in social causes.  
- However, ""socialworker"" identifies a profession, while ""founder"" identifies organizational leadership.  
- The target is quite specific (founder of a specific nonprofit), while ""socialworker"" is quite general.  
- It is borderline, but since it's a close semantic field (social cause, nonprofit), and the criterion allows approximate expressions, this can be accepted as approximately the same.  

Score: 1

### idx_2  
- Target: ""techentrepreneur;foundertechlitafrica""  
- Response: ""socialentrepreneur""  
Analysis:  
- Target: tech entrepreneur and founder of a tech-related organization.  
- Response: social entrepreneur.  
- Both entail entrepreneurship and starting organizations aiming at impact, though slightly different sectors.  
- ""Tech entrepreneur"" is specific to technology; ""social entrepreneur"" emphasizes social impact.  
- Founding a social tech org could mean the two are very close semantically.  
- The criterion states approximate expression of background/occupation is sufficient.  
- Since the core meaning (founder/entrepreneur with impact) is shared, this is acceptable.  

Score: 1

### idx_3  
- Target: ""veterinarian;founderprojectstreetvet""

- No overlap in domain or role here.  
- The meanings do NOT approximate each other or point to the same entity.  
- Not acceptable.

- ""Chemical engineer"" is more specific but ""innovator"" is more general and still in related semantic space regarding creativity and invention.  
- Since ""innovator"" does encompass the inventor role and the criterion allows approximate background/occupation expressions, this is sufficient.  

Score: 1

### idx_1  
- Target: ""thefounderofthenon-profitbeauty2thestreetz""  
- Response: ""socialworker""  
Analysis:  
- The target is a founder of a specific nonprofit. The response is ""socialworker.""  
- A social worker is a profession concerned with helping people; a founder is a role of creating an organization.  
- Being the founder of a nonprofit may imply social/contributive work, but ""socialworker"" and ""founder of a nonprofit"" are not exactly the same semantic roles.  
- The criterion says approximate expressions are okay if meaning is similar; here, founding a nonprofit is more specific than just being a social worker. But ""socialworker"" is not an unreasonable simplification; both imply engagement in social causes.  
- However, ""socialworker"" identifies a profession, while ""founder"" identifies organizational leadership.  
- The target is quite specific (founder of a specific nonprofit), while ""socialworker"" is quite general.  
- It is borderline, but since it's a close semantic field (social cause, nonprofit), and the criterion allows approximate expressions, this can be accepted as approximately the same.  

Score: 1

### idx_2  
- Target: ""techentrepreneur;foundertechlitafrica""  
- Response: ""socialentrepreneur""  
Analysis:  
- Target: tech entrepreneur and founder of a tech-related organization.  
- Response: social entrepreneur.  
- Both entail entrepreneurship and starting organizations aiming at impact, though slightly different sectors.  
- ""Tech entrepreneur"" is specific to technology; ""social entrepreneur"" emphasizes social impact.  
- Founding a social tech org could mean the two are very close semantically.  
- The criterion states approximate expression of background/occupation is sufficient.  
- Since the core meaning (founder/entrepreneur with impact) is shared, this is acceptable.  

Score: 1

### idx_3  
- Target: ""veterinarian;founderprojectstreetvet""  
- Response: ""psychiatrist""  
Analysis:  
- Target is a vet and founder of a project for animal care.  
- Response says psychiatrist, which is a medical field but focused on humans' mental health, completely different from vet.  
- No overlap in domain or role here.  
- The meanings do NOT approximate each other or point to the same entity.  
- Not acceptable.  

Score: 0

### idx_4  
- Target: ""non-profitexec;founderdogsmatter""  
- Response: ""founder,dogsmatter""  
Analysis:  
- Target: nonprofit executive and founder of Dogs Matter.  
- Response: founder of Dogs Matter.  
- Response captures the key entity (""founder of Dogs Matter"") and is semantically equivalent.  
- Omitting ""non-profit exec"" is acceptable as per criterion (approximate background).  
- Clearly acceptable.
