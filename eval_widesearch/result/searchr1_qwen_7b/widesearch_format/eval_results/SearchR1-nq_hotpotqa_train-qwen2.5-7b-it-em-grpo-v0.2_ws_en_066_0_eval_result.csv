### idx_6  
- Response: ""rmb2499""

Close values: 2499 vs 2799, difference of 300 RMB (~10-11%). Could be seen as roughly similar depending on tolerance, but criterion does not specify a threshold for approximation. Assuming the criterion expects ""approximate"" to be close enough semantically.

300 difference on roughly 2,500 is about 12% difference.

This may be borderline.

Given the criterion is vague (only states ""approximately the same"" or ""point to the same entity""), this might be enough for 1 since they both refer to similar price points in RMB.

### idx_0

### idx_3

### idx_4  
- Response: ""rmb1499""

### idx_6  
- Response: ""rmb2499""  
- Target: ""¥2799""  
Close values: 2499 vs 2799, difference of 300 RMB (~10-11%). Could be seen as roughly similar depending on tolerance, but criterion does not specify a threshold for approximation. Assuming the criterion expects ""approximate"" to be close enough semantically.

300 difference on roughly 2,500 is about 12% difference.

This may be borderline.

Given the criterion is vague (only states ""approximately the same"" or ""point to the same entity""), this might be enough for 1 since they both refer to similar price points in RMB.
