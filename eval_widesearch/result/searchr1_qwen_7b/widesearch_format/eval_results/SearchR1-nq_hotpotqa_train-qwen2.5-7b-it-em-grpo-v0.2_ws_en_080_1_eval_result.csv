brazil,Brazil,,,2024parisolympics,2024 Paris Olympics,1.0,key_match,1.0,"Let's analyze each item step-by-step according to the criterion:

Criterion Summary:  
- The semantics should be approximately the same or point to the same entity.
- No need for exact word matches, but the response should reference the same or approximately the same entities as the target.
- Scoring is binary: 0 or 1 only.

---

**idx_0:**  
- Response: basketball, fencing, gymnastics, weightlifting  
- Target: judo, gymnastics, volleyball  

Analysis:  
- Both have ""gymnastics"" in common.  
- Other sports differ entirely.  
- The response mentions ""basketball, fencing, weightlifting"" which are not in the target. The target mentions ""judo"" and ""volleyball"" which are not in the response.  
- Since there is at least one common entity (gymnastics), the response partially matches the target, which satisfies the criterion ""semantics are approximately the same or point to the same entity.""

Score: 1

---

**idx_1:**  
- Response: swimming, athletics  
- Target: canoeing, surfing, gymnastics, sailing, swimming, boxing, football  

Analysis:  
- Response contains ""swimming,"" which is also in the target.  
- ""Athletics"" is not mentioned in the target, but no strict requirement that all items must be correct or all listed—just approximate match or pointing to same entities is sufficient.  
- At least one matching entity (""swimming"") means this is sufficient.

Score: 1

---

**idx_2:**  
- Response: athletics, fencing  
- Target: judo, athletics, boxing, sailing, volleyball(2), football  

Analysis:  
- ""athletics"" is common in both.  
- ""fencing"" is not in the target, but presence of one shared entity (""athletics"") meets the approximate semantics requirement.  
- So the response points to one target entity.

Score: 1
