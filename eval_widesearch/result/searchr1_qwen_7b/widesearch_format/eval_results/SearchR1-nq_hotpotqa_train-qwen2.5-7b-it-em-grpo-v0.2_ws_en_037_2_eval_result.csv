cameronhamilton&laurenspeed,Lauren & Cameron,,,1.0,key_match,1.0,"Let's analyze each pair according to the criterion:

Criterion summary:  
- The meaning of the response should approximately match the target (reference answer) in semantics or refer to the same entity.  
- No need for exact wording.  
- Scoring is 0 or 1 only.

---

### idx_0  
- Response: '1'  
- Target: 'season1'  
Analysis:  
The response ""1"" likely refers to ""season 1"", which matches the target ""season1"" exactly in semantics. They both refer to the same season.  
Score: 1

---

### idx_1  
- Response: '3'  
- Target: 'season4'  
Analysis:  
Response ""3"" presumably means ""season 3"" or just ""3"". Target is ""season4"". These are different entities (season 3 vs season 4). Thus, the semantics are not approximately the same.  
Score: 0

---

### idx_2  
- Response: '2'  
- Target: 'season4'  
Analysis:  
Response ""2"" presumably means ""season 2"" vs target ""season4"" (season 4). Different entities again, so no semantic equivalence.  
Score: 0
