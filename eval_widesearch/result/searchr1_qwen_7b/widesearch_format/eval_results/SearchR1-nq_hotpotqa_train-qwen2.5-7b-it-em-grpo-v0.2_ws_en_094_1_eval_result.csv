,,themanfromnowhere,The Man from Nowhere,1.0,"Let's analyze each pair individually according to the criterion:

Criterion summary:  
- Semantics should be approximately the same or point to the same entity.  
- No strict word-for-word matching needed.

**idx_0**  
- Response: ""leejeong-beom""  
- Target: ""leejeong-beom""  
- Analysis: Both are exactly the same. This meets the criterion fully.  
- Score: 1

- Analysis: The response and the target refer to different entities (different names). This does not meet the criterion.

**idx_0**  
- Response: ""action/thriller""  
- Target: ""action""  
Analysis:  
The response contains ""action"" as part of a compound genre. It points to the same entity ""action"" present in the target. According to the criterion, this is sufficient.

- Response: ""action/drama""  
- Target: ""action""  
Analysis:  
Similarly, ""action/drama"" contains ""action"", which matches the target entity. The addition of ""/drama"" doesn't negate the presence of ""action"" and thus semantically points to the same entity. Therefore, it meets the requirement.
