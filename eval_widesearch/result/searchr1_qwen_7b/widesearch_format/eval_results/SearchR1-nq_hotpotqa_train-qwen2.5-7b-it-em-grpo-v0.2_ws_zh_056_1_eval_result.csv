,,张继平,张继平,0.0,"number not convertable, response: None, target: 1958.0",1958,NULL,1.0,"Let's analyze each pair according to the grading criteria:

Criterion: The response and the target should be semantically similar or refer to the same entity; exact wording is not necessary.

1. idx_0:
- Response: 北京大学
- Target: 北京大学
- Analysis: The response exactly matches the target entity. Hence, it is a completely correct answer.
- Score: 1

2. idx_1:
- Response: 北京大学
- Target: 复旦大学
- Analysis: The response refers to 北京大学, while the target is 复旦大学. These are two distinct universities, so they do not indicate the same entity.
- Score: 0

Final scores:

    ""idx_0"": 1,
    ""idx_1"": 0

Criterion summary: The response only needs to be semantically roughly the same or refer to the same entity as the target. Exact word-for-word match is not required.

1. idx_0:
- Response: ""陈省身数学奖""
- Target: ""陈省身数学奖""
- They are exactly the same.
- According to the criterion, this is a completely correct match.
- Score: 1

2. idx_1:
- Response: ""陈省身数学奖""
- Target: ""nan"" (which likely means no target or target is not available)
- Since the target is nan, we cannot determine correctness.
- Generally, such items with no valid target cannot be scored positively.
