**idx_3**  
Response: ""action""  
Target: ""historicalaction"" (likely ""historical action"" or combined word)  
Are these semantically approx the same?  
- ""Historical action"" is a subgenre combining history and action, while ""action"" is broader. The response only says ""action,"" which is included in ""historical action,"" so arguably approximate but less specific.  
- Criterion says ""approximately the same or point to the same entity."" Action is part of historical action. Is ""action"" enough to match ""historical action""? The target is more specific, but the answer points to the root category. Usually acceptable to give credit if semantics overlap.
