### idx_2  
- Response: ""wongkar-wai""  
- Target: ""karwaiwong""  
This is the same pair as idx_0, so the same reasoning applies.

Score: 1

---

### idx_3  
- Response: ""chenger""  
- Target: ""ercheng""  
Analysis:  
""chenger"" and ""ercheng"" look similar, with characters seemingly swapped or close typos. This very likely refers to the same entity or name, just differently ordered or slightly misspelled. The criterion accepts approximate semantics or pointing to the same entity.

Score: 1

### Final scoring results:

---

### idx_0:
- **Target:** ""block2pictures(hongkong)\nocéanfilms(france)""
- **Response:** ""-""
- Analysis: The response is just a dash, meaning no answer or no attempt to answer. The target lists two film companies with locations. Since no answer is provided, the semantics cannot be matched.
- Score: 0

---

### idx_1:
- **Target:**  
  ""focusfeatures(unitedstates)\nchinafilmgroupcorporation(china)\nedkofilms(hongkong)\nbuenavistainternational(taiwan)""
- **Response:** ""-""
- Analysis: Same as above, no response provided means no match.
- Score: 0

---

### idx_2:
- **Target:**  
  ""larkfilmsdistribution(hongkong)\nchinafilmgroupcorporation(china)""
- **Response:** ""-""
- Analysis: No response, so no semantic matching possible.
- Score: 0

### idx_3:
- **Target:**  
  ""polybonafilms\nchinafilmco.\nhuaxiafilm\nalibabapictures""
- **Response:** ""-""
- Analysis: No response, no matching.

Criterion: It is sufficient if the semantics are approximately the same as the reference answer or if they point to the same entity. There is no need for a word-for-word correspondence.

---

**idx_0**  
- Response: ""maggiecheung""  
- Target: ""maggiecheung""  
Analysis: The response exactly matches the target. They point to the same entity with the same string.  
Score: 1

---

**idx_1**  
- Response: ""suli-zhen""  
- Target: ""weitang""  
Analysis: The response and the target are completely different strings and seem to point to different entities. No approximate or semantic equivalence.  
Score: 0

---

**idx_2**  
- Response: ""zhangziyi""  
- Target: ""ziyizhang""  
Analysis: These are permutations of the same name (probably ""Ziyi Zhang"" arranged differently). Since the semantics refer to the same entity (a known celebrity with that name) but the strings differ in order, this meets the criterion of approximate semantics pointing to the same entity.  
Score: 1

---

**idx_3**  
- Response: ""andylau""  
- Target: ""xunzhou""  
Analysis: These are two different names, likely different persons; no semantic equivalence or same entity reference.  
Score: 0
