### idx_0:
- Response: ""avengers:thekangdynasty""
- Target: ""theavengers""

Analysis:  
The response mentions ""avengers: the kang dynasty"" while the target is simply ""the avengers."" The response references a specific movie within the Avengers series, while the target is just the general ""The Avengers."" Since the criterion allows for pointing to the same entity, or roughly the same meaning, this is contentious.  
Is ""avengers: the kang dynasty"" pointing to the same entity as ""the avengers""?  
No.  
- ""The Avengers"" is the 2012 movie (or generally the Avengers team).  
- ""Avengers: The Kang Dynasty"" is a future movie, a sequel and not the same as the original ""The Avengers.""  
They are different specific movies/entities, thus not considered the same entity.  

Therefore, response does **not** meet the criterion as they point to different movies/entitles.  
Score: 0

### idx_1:
- Response: ""shang-chiandthelegendofthetenrings:partii""
- Target: ""shang-chiandthelegendofthetenrings""

Analysis:  
The response is ""Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings: Part II"" while the target is ""Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings.""  
The response points to the sequel of the target movie. They are not exactly the same entity, but the sequel is a different movie. According to the criterion, pointing to the same entity or roughly the same meaning is required, not sequel/prequel or related.  
Hence, different entities.  
Score: 0
