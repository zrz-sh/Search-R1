```",750ml,750ml,1.0,key_match,0.0,"Let's analyze each idx pair one by one against the grading criteria:

---

**idx_0**

- Target answer: ""blendedscotchwhisky""
- Response: ""blended""

Analysis:  
""blended"" is a shortened form and is semantically very close to ""blended scotch whisky."" The criterion states that approximate semantics are sufficient, and pointing to the same entity is enough. Here, ""blended"" clearly refers to ""blended scotch whisky.""  
Score: 1

---

**idx_1**

- Target answer: ""blendedscotchwhisky""
- Response: ""blended""

Same reasoning as idx_0.  
Score: 1

---

**idx_2**

- Target answer: ""blendedscotchwhisky""
- Response: ""blended""

Same reasoning as idx_0.  
Score: 1

---

**idx_3**

- Target answer: ""frenchvodka""
- Response: ""nan""

""nan"" appears to denote no answer or missing answer. The criterion does not say anything about partial or missing responses, so no match here; zero score.  
Score: 0

---

**idx_4**

- Target answer: ""premiumvodka""
- Response: ""nan""

Same as idx_3, no answer given, so zero score.  
Score: 0
