Criterion: 
- Semantics approximately the same or referring to the same entity is sufficient.
- No need for word-for-word match.

---

Pair idx_0:  
- Response: ""nigelfarage""  
- Target: ""adamwalker""  
Analysis:  
- ""nigelfarage"" and ""adamwalker"" are two different people.  
- They do not point to the same entity or have similar semantic meaning.  
- Therefore, this should score 0.

---

Pair idx_1:  
- Response: ""marinelepen""  
- Target: ""marinelepen""  
Analysis:  
- Exactly the same name.  
- This clearly satisfies the criterion.  
- Score 1.

**Item idx_0**

- **Response:** ""conservativeparty""  
- **Target:** ""conservative""

Analysis:  
- The target is ""conservative,"" likely referring to the Conservative party in a shortened form.  
- The response adds ""party,"" making it ""conservativeparty,"" which is a more explicit term but still points to the same entity.  
- Semantically, both refer to the same political group. The response is not incorrect; it captures the intended entity fully.  
- According to the criterion, the response is acceptable because the meanings are equivalent.

Score: 1

---

**Item idx_1**

- **Response:** ""emmanuelmacron(larépubliqueenmarche)""  
- **Target:** ""larépubliqueenmarche!""

Analysis:  
- The target is ""larépubliqueenmarche!"", the name of the political party.  
- The response includes both ""emmanuelmacron"" (the leader or key figure) and the party name in parentheses, ""larépubliqueenmarche.""  
- The criterion allows approximate semantics or same entities, so mentioning Macron plus the party is acceptable since it points to the same political entity.  
- The reference answer has an exclamation mark at the end; the response does not. This punctuation difference is negligible and does not affect semantic equivalence.  
- The response clearly indicates the party ""larépubliqueenmarche.""  
- Therefore, the response is semantically consistent with the target.
