Criterion summary:
- The response’s semantics should be approximately the same as the reference answer or point to the same entity.
- No need for exact word-for-word correspondence.
- Partial/missing corresponding scores are acceptable.

### idx_0 analysis

**Reference answer (target):**  
- culturalstudiesandcapitalism  
- 30 credits  
- doingculturalstudies  
- 30 credits  
- maculturalstudiesdissertation(methodologyandresearch)  
- 60 credits

**Response:**  
- culturaltheory  
- culturalpolicy  
- culturaleconomy  
- culturalpractice

**Judgment:**  
- The reference focuses on specific modules related to cultural studies and a dissertation, with credit values (30 or 60).  
- The response lists four topics that seem related to culture but do not match the modules or the dissertation titles.  
- The response does not mention credits or the dissertation requirement indicated by the reference.  
- Semantically, the response does not point to the same entities or modules; they rather name different cultural topics.  
- Therefore, the response does NOT meet the criterion of approximate semantic equivalence or pointing to the same entities.

**Score:** 0

### idx_1 analysis

- introductiontomediaandcommunicationstheory  
- 30 credits  
- dissertation  
- 60 credits

**Response:**  
- researchmethodsinmediastudies  
- mediaandsociety  
- mediaindustries  
- communicationtheory

**Judgment:**  
- The reference includes Intro to Media and Communications theory (30 credits) and a 60-credit dissertation.  
- The response lists courses that are thematically related: research methods, media and society, media industries, and communication theory.  
- The response includes ""communication theory,"" which is close to ""communication theory"" in reference; however, lacks the explicit mention of a dissertation or credit values.  
- The entities/topics roughly point to the same field but do not include the dissertation, a significant entity in the reference.  
- The criterion states it is sufficient if semantics are approximately the same or point to the same entity. Missing corresponding scores (credits) are acceptable. The dissertation is arguably a key part of the course, which is missing here.  
- However, the response contains a subset of topics related to the course but misses the dissertation, which is arguably a key component.  
- The key to the criterion is whether the main entities are matched or not. Here, the response mostly lists different modules, not the ""introduction"" module or dissertation.  
- Given that the response is thematically related but does not mention the dissertation at all, and a core part of the credit allocation is not present, it suggests it does not fully correspond to the target.  

Considering that the reference focuses on a specific introduction module and dissertation with credits, and the response lists different courses without dissertation, it indicates the response is not semantically approximately equal or pointing to the key entities in the reference.

---

**Item idx_0**  
- Target: ""30+30+60""  
- Response: ""180""  

Analysis:  
The target expression sums to 30 + 30 + 60 = 120 (if done normally). But the response says ""180"". This indicates that the response is not exactly matching the sum of the target expression.  

However, according to the criterion, it is acceptable if the model outputs the calculated score. Here, the model outputs ""180"" instead of ""120"". Since the target involves 30, 30, and 60, the sum should be 120—not 180. Thus, the response does not correctly calculate the sum.  

Although the criterion allows for approximate semantic equivalence or output of the calculated score, the response here is invalid for this input because the numeric value is wrong. Hence, score should be 0.

---

**Item idx_1**  
- Target: ""30+60""  
- Response: ""180""  

Analysis:  
The target sums to 30 + 60 = 90. The response says ""180"". As per the criterion, outputting the correct calculated score is acceptable. Here, ""180"" is incorrect for ""30+60"". Hence, the response is not semantically equivalent (wrong numeric result). Score is 0.

- The target answer specifies a specific IELTS score: 6.5 (with 6.5 in writing and no element lower than 6.0).  
- The response is a slash ""/"" which is unrelated and does not convey any semantic meaning close to the target answer.

- The target further specifies ""with a 6.5 in writing and no element lower than 6.0,"" but the criterion says approximate semantic match or pointing to the same entity is sufficient.

Analysis:
- The response specifies the duration ""1year,"" which matches the duration part of the target.
- The target includes ""full-time"" specifying the nature of the commitment.
- The response omits ""full-time.""
- Does the omission of ""full-time"" affect the semantics significantly based on the criterion?
- The criterion says ""approximately the same"" or point to the same entity.
- Since ""1year"" generally represents the duration part, and ""full-time"" is an additional specification, this could be seen as partially correct but not fully capturing the full meaning.
- However, the criterion is lenient - it is sufficient if semantics are approximately the same or point to same entity.
- The response ""1year"" likely misses the ""full-time"" meaning, which could be important.
- But since the core entity is the ""duration"" of 1 year, and no other entity is contradicted or changed, we can consider it acceptable.
