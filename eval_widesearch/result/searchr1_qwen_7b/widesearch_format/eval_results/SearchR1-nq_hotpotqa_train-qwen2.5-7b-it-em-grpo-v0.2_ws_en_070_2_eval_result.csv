Minimum requirements: TOEFL: 80 | IELTS: 6.0 (with no sub-score below 5.5).""

**Analysis:**  
- Response only mentions bachelor's degree from a recognized institution.  
- Target includes additional elements: 2 reference letters + English proficiency requirements.  
- The response covers only a part of the target, missing significant parts of the requirement (references and English proficiency).  
- According to the criterion, they must at least be approximately the same or point to the same entity. Response only covers part of it.  
- Does the response point to the same entity? The threshold (""hold recognized bachelor’s degree or an equivalent"") is partially matched by ""applicants should possess a bachelor’s degree from a recognized institution."" But target expects more requirements.  
- The response misses key parts; so the semantic coverage is incomplete and can't be considered fully correct. However, since partial match is allowed if semantics are approximately the same or point to the same entity—does it qualify? Because reference letters and English proficiency are essential parts of the answer, missing them reduces correctness.

2. English language requirements for admission:

**Analysis:**  
- Response is again only: ""applicants should possess a bachelor's degree from a recognized institution.""  
- Target contains detailed academic score requirements, English proficiency requirements, GMAT/GRE info, equivalent qualifications.  
- Response only matches the first very basic part (having a recognized bachelor's degree).  
- The remainder of the answer is missing.

**Verdict for idx_2:** 0

### Summary:

All responses use the same minimal sentence about having a bachelor's degree from a recognized institution but omit other significant and necessary requirements listed in the target answers.

According to the grading criterion (semantic equivalence is enough), and since the responses do not critically contradict the references but only provide incomplete info, one could argue the responses express the core requirement. However, the targets include multiple requirements besides the bachelor's degree, mainly English proficiency and references, which responses ignore.

Since the criterion says ""It is sufficient if the semantics are approximately the same as the reference answer or if they point to the same entity,"" and all responses at least mention the key entity ""bachelor's degree from recognized institution,"" then all responses fulfill the minimal semantic equivalence regarding degree requirement.

But should the missing key parts (references, tests) count negatively?

Given the criterion allows approximate semantic sameness, and the answer is rather minimal but covers the degree requirement (the ""entity"" central to all targets), it is acceptable to give a score of 1 for approximate equivalence here.

However, the instructions say: ""The score can only be 0 or 1.""

If a response only partially matches, but semantics approximately refer to the same entity, it's acceptable for 1.

If important key requirements (like English proficiency) are missing, and responses do not mention them, it's less aligned.

We have conflicting considerations:

- For idx_0 and idx_1 and idx_2, responses only mention bachelor’s degree, no English proficiency or references.

- Targets always mention either English proficiency or references along with the degree.

- The criterion says ""It is sufficient if the semantics are approximately the same as the reference answer or if they point to the same entity."" The responses do point to the same entity (degree).

Therefore, by strict application of the criterion, they deserve 1.

If the criterion had said ""must contain all key requirements,"" responses would be scored 0.

Hence final scoring, applying criterion strictly as requested:
