,,princetonuniversity,Princeton,1.0,"Let's analyze the provided response against the standard answer according to the grading criteria:

- idx_0:
  - Standard answer: ""ivyleague""
  - Response: ""ivyleague""
  - The response exactly matches the standard answer.
  - According to the criterion, an exact or semantically equivalent answer scores 1.

Final scoring:

```json
{
    ""idx_0"": 1
}
```",ivyleague,ivyleague,1.0,"Step-by-step analysis:

- Standard answer (target): ""us""
- Response: ""usa""

The grading criterion states that it is sufficient if the semantics are approximately the same or point to the same entity, no need for word-for-word correspondence.

""us"" and ""usa"" both refer to the United States of America. ""us"" is an abbreviation for ""United States,"" and ""usa"" is also widely recognized as the same country.

Since both responses point to the same entity (United States), the semantics are effectively the same.

Therefore, the response is correct.

Final scoring:

```json
{
    ""idx_0"": 1
}
```",us,usa,1.0,"Let's analyze the given pair step-by-step according to the provided grading criteria.

---

### Given:

- **Response idx_0:** ""notspecified""
- **Target idx_0:** ""nominimumgpaspecified""

---

### Step 1: Understand the Target Answer

- The target indicates that **no minimum GPA was specified**.
- In other words, the question or context presumably asked about a minimum GPA requirement, and the correct answer states that **no minimum GPA is specified**.

### Step 2: Analyze the Response

- The response ""notspecified"" implies something is not specified.
- Although it does not explicitly mention ""no minimum GPA"", it generally conveys the same idea that some expected information (here, minimum GPA) is not specified.
- The grading criteria accept approximate semantics that point to the same entity even without exact wording.

### Step 3: Check the Criteria

- From the criterion: ""It is sufficient if the semantics are approximately the same as the reference answer or if they point to the same entity.""
- ""notspecified"" matches the notion that ""no minimum GPA specified"" because the main idea is the absence of a minimum GPA requirement.

### Conclusion:

- The response conveys the primary idea of the target answer adequately.
- Therefore, the score should be **1** (completely correct).
