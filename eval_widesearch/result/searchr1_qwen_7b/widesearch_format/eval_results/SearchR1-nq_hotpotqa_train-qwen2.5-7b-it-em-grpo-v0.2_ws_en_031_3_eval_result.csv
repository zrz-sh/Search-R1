- Target: ""angelinajolie""
- Analysis: Both are exactly the same string, so clearly the same entity.

### Pair idx_0

- **Target:** ""rembrandtawards-bestinternationalactress""
- **Response:** ""nan""

**Analysis:**

- The target mentions the ""rembrandt awards - best international actress"".
- The response ""nan"" means no meaningful answer was provided.
- According to the criterion, the response must have at least approximate semantics or point to the same entity. Here, the response gives nothing.

- **Response:** ""nan""

**Analysis:**

- The target lists three specific awards.
- The response ""nan"" contains no meaningful or approximate semantic reference.
- Therefore, it doesn't fulfill the requirement.

**idx_0**

- Target answer: ""evelynsalt""
- Response: ""salt""

Analysis: ""salt"" is part of the name ""evelynsalt,"" which suggests a possible reference to the same entity ""Evelyn Salt."" However, ""salt"" alone is a very generic word and could relate to many things, but since the criterion allows approximate semantics or pointing to the same entity, this partial match seems acceptable.

Conclusion: The response ""salt"" semantically points to ""evelynsalt.""
