(Meaning: The response and the reference answer should be roughly semantically the same or refer to the same entity; exact word-for-word correspondence is not necessary.)

---

### idx_0
- Response: ""64-256000""
- Target: ""iso64-25600""
- Analysis: The reference answer indicates an ISO range from 64 to 25600, and the response has an upper bound of 256000, which is an order of magnitude higher, possibly a typo or exaggeration. While the lower bound matches (64), the upper bound is wrong. It does not point to the same entity since it expands the ISO upper limit by a factor of 10, which is not roughly the same range.
- Verdict: Not semantically consistent, score = 0.

### idx_1
- Response: ""64-256000""
- Target: ""iso100-51200""
- Analysis: Response range is 64 to 256000; reference is 100 to 51200. Both lower and upper limits do not match (64 vs 100 lower, and 256000 vs 51200 upper). The ranges do not semantically match or point to the same entity. 256000 is much higher than 51200; 64 is lower than 100.
- Verdict: Semantic mismatch, score = 0.

### idx_2
- Response: ""64-25600""
- Target: ""iso100-51200""
- Analysis: Lower end in response is 64 vs 100 in target; upper end is 25600 vs 51200. Although the ranges don't exactly coincide, they partially overlap which could be considered roughly similar in certain contexts, but the criterion allows ""大致相同"" (roughly the same). Here the ranges are half or double of each other: lower and upper limits are different but still in the same ISO context. Since both refer to ISO ranges most likely, this can be considered pointing to the same entity roughly.
- Verdict: Semantic roughly consistent, score = 1.

### idx_3
- Response: ""64-25600""
- Target: ""iso100-51200""
- Analysis: The same as idx_2.
- Verdict: 1.

### idx_4
- Response: ""100-25600""
- Target: ""iso100-51200""
- Analysis: Lower limit matches exactly (100). Upper limit is 25600 vs 51200. These differ by a factor of 2, but the ranges still share the same domain context of ISO settings. Pointing to the same entity roughly.
- Verdict: 1.

参考答案涉及快门速度范围，重点是快门速度的最高和最低值，以及范围的合理性。评分依据是“语义相同大致、或者指向的实体一致即可”，括号内容未提及也算对，快门速度范围的上下限可以有一定微调（根据实际范围进行调整1/3或1/2EV步长调整），并且可以将30秒扩展到900秒。

对应关系中，response的快门速度范围为“1/4000s-30s+b”（假设“+b”是后续简写，忽略不影响评判），而参考答案分别是：

逐项分析：

idx_0：  
response的范围是1/4000秒至30秒  
目标：1/8000至30秒（以1/3或1/2ev为步长微调），可理解为快门速度最低端是1/8000秒。但可根据实际范围进行调整，1/4000与1/8000差了一档，即1/2ev，属于允许的微调范围吗？快门速度范围允许上下微调1/3或1/2EV，1/4000相较于1/8000低档一档，即1/2 EV（一般会以1/3或1/2 EV调整，1/4000确实是1/3 EV或者1/2 EV的一挡），因此这属于合理范围内的调整，且最高速度和秒数吻合。括号内容是否涉及可忽略。故语义大致相同，分数1。

idx_1：   
同idx_0，唯一差别是括号里额外说明了m模式下可扩展至900s，response中未提及括号内容，根据评分标准，括号内容未提及也算对。快门速度范围的最低值“1/4000”相比参考答案的“1/8000”属于可接受范围内调整，最高值一样30秒。分数1。

idx_2：

idx_4：

**idx_0**  
- Response: 约7幅/秒  
- Target: 约9幅/秒  
Analysis: 7 and 9 are close but noticeably different values. Since the criterion allows approximate semantic equivalence, but here 7 versus 9 is a quantitative numeric difference that could change meaning. Usually, a difference of about 20-30% could be acceptable if the context is loose, but without context, a difference of 7 vs 9 is around 22% off. The criterion says ""或指向的实体一致"" (or refer to the same entity). Here, both refer to some rate (frames per second), but numerical values differ. Since exact numbers matter, and ""约"" means about but this is a number difference, I think this counts as different answers. So 0.

1. idx_0  
   - response: ""vr减震"" (VR image stabilization)  
   - target: ""影像传感器5轴移动"" (5-axis movement of image sensor)  
   - Analysis:  
     - ""VR减震"" is commonly understood as ""vibration reduction"" or image stabilization technology related to lens or sensor movement.  
     - The target specifically mentions ""image sensor 5-axis movement,"" which corresponds closely to in-body image stabilization via sensor shift.  
     - Although wording is different, the meaning/entity referred is effectively the same (image stabilization by sensor shifts).

Criterion: ""和参考答案语义相同大致、或者指向的实体一致即可，不需要字字对应。""
Translation: The meaning should be generally the same, or point to the same entity; exact word-for-word matching is not required.

Since the items are numeric weights with units (grams) specified approximately (using ""约""), the key is whether the response value is reasonably close to the target value, as the criterion implies approximate or generally same entity suffices.

Now analyze each pair:

- idx_0:
  - Response: 约815g
  - Target: 约675g
  - Difference: 140g more than target, which is roughly 20% higher.
  - Is this ""大致相同""? 20% difference is quite large for a weight value measured approximately, but since ""约"" indicates approximation, let's consider if this is close enough.
  - 675g vs 815g: difference seems significant.
  - Considering normal rounding or approximation, 140g difference on 675g is large. Probably no.

- idx_1:
  - Response: 约645g
  - Target: 约705g
  - Difference: 60g less than target, around 8.5% difference.
  - 645g and 705g difference is smaller percentage than idx_0, but still a difference.
  - Given ""约"" implies approximation and criterion is lenient, this can be considered consistent.

- idx_2:
  - Response: 约655g
  - Target: 约675g
  - Difference: 20g less than target, about 3% difference.
  - Very close. Definitely counts as correct.

- idx_3:
  - Response: 约715g
  - Target: 约675g
  - Difference: 40g more, about 6% higher.
  - Also close and consistent with the target.

- idx_4:
  - Response: 约565g
  - Target: 约450g
  - Difference: 115g more, about 25% higher than target.
  - Similar to idx_0, difference seems large.
  - Possible no.

Summary of judgement:

- idx_0: 815g vs 675g too large difference → 0
- idx_1: 645g vs 705g close enough → 1
- idx_2: 655g vs 675g close → 1

Criterion: ""和参考答案语义相同大致、或者指向的实体一致即可，不需要字字对应。""
Translation: The meaning should be generally the same, or point to the same entity; exact word-for-word matching is not required.

Since the items are numeric weights with units (grams) specified approximately (using ""约""), the key is whether the response value is reasonably close to the target value, as the criterion implies approximate or generally same entity suffices.

Now analyze each pair:

- idx_0:
  - Response: 约815g
  - Target: 约675g
  - Difference: 140g more than target, which is roughly 20% higher.
  - Is this ""大致相同""? 20% difference is quite large for a weight value measured approximately, but since ""约"" indicates approximation, let's consider if this is close enough.
  - 675g vs 815g: difference seems significant.
  - Considering normal rounding or approximation, 140g difference on 675g is large. Probably no.

- idx_1:
  - Response: 约645g
  - Target: 约705g
  - Difference: 60g less than target, around 8.5% difference.
  - 645g and 705g difference is smaller percentage than idx_0, but still a difference.
  - Given ""约"" implies approximation and criterion is lenient, this can be considered consistent.

- idx_2:
  - Response: 约655g
  - Target: 约675g
  - Difference: 20g less than target, about 3% difference.
  - Very close. Definitely counts as correct.

- idx_3:
  - Response: 约715g
  - Target: 约675g
  - Difference: 40g more, about 6% higher.
  - Also close and consistent with the target.

- idx_4:
  - Response: 约565g
  - Target: 约450g
  - Difference: 115g more, about 25% higher than target.
  - Similar to idx_0, difference seems large.
  - Possible no.

Summary of judgement:

### idx_0
- Response: ""64-256000""
- Target: ""iso64-25600""
- Analysis: The reference answer indicates an ISO range from 64 to 25600, and the response has an upper bound of 256000, which is an order of magnitude higher, possibly a typo or exaggeration. While the lower bound matches (64), the upper bound is wrong. It does not point to the same entity since it expands the ISO upper limit by a factor of 10, which is not roughly the same range.
- Verdict: Not semantically consistent, score = 0.

### idx_1
- Response: ""64-256000""
- Target: ""iso100-51200""
- Analysis: Response range is 64 to 256000; reference is 100 to 51200. Both lower and upper limits do not match (64 vs 100 lower, and 256000 vs 51200 upper). The ranges do not semantically match or point to the same entity. 256000 is much higher than 51200; 64 is lower than 100.
- Verdict: Semantic mismatch, score = 0.

### idx_2
- Response: ""64-25600""
- Target: ""iso100-51200""
- Analysis: Lower end in response is 64 vs 100 in target; upper end is 25600 vs 51200. Although the ranges don't exactly coincide, they partially overlap which could be considered roughly similar in certain contexts, but the criterion allows ""大致相同"" (roughly the same). Here the ranges are half or double of each other: lower and upper limits are different but still in the same ISO context. Since both refer to ISO ranges most likely, this can be considered pointing to the same entity roughly.
- Verdict: Semantic roughly consistent, score = 1.

### idx_3
- Response: ""64-25600""

目标：1/8000至30秒（以1/3或1/2ev为步长微调），可理解为快门速度最低端是1/8000秒。但可根据实际范围进行调整，1/4000与1/8000差了一档，即1/2ev，属于允许的微调范围吗？快门速度范围允许上下微调1/3或1/2EV，1/4000相较于1/8000低档一档，即1/2 EV（一般会以1/3或1/2 EV调整，1/4000确实是1/3 EV或者1/2 EV的一挡），因此这属于合理范围内的调整，且最高速度和秒数吻合。括号内容是否涉及可忽略。故语义大致相同，分数1。

idx_1：   
同idx_0，唯一差别是括号里额外说明了m模式下可扩展至900s，response中未提及括号内容，根据评分标准，括号内容未提及也算对。快门速度范围的最低值“1/4000”相比参考答案的“1/8000”属于可接受范围内调整，最高值一样30秒。分数1。

**idx_0**  
- Response: 约7幅/秒  
- Target: 约9幅/秒  
Analysis: 7 and 9 are close but noticeably different values. Since the criterion allows approximate semantic equivalence, but here 7 versus 9 is a quantitative numeric difference that could change meaning. Usually, a difference of about 20-30% could be acceptable if the context is loose, but without context, a difference of 7 vs 9 is around 22% off. The criterion says ""或指向的实体一致"" (or refer to the same entity). Here, both refer to some rate (frames per second), but numerical values differ. Since exact numbers matter, and ""约"" means about but this is a number difference, I think this counts as different answers. So 0.

**idx_0**  
- Response: 约7幅/秒  
- Target: 约9幅/秒  
Analysis: 7 and 9 are close but noticeably different values. Since the criterion allows approximate semantic equivalence, but here 7 versus 9 is a quantitative numeric difference that could change meaning. Usually, a difference of about 20-30% could be acceptable if the context is loose, but without context, a difference of 7 vs 9 is around 22% off. The criterion says ""或指向的实体一致"" (or refer to the same entity). Here, both refer to some rate (frames per second), but numerical values differ. Since exact numbers matter, and ""约"" means about but this is a number difference, I think this counts as different answers. So 0.

Criterion: ""和参考答案语义相同大致、或者指向的实体一致即可，不需要字字对应。""
Translation: The meaning should be generally the same, or point to the same entity; exact word-for-word matching is not required.

Since the items are numeric weights with units (grams) specified approximately (using ""约""), the key is whether the response value is reasonably close to the target value, as the criterion implies approximate or generally same entity suffices.

Now analyze each pair:

- idx_0:
  - Response: 约815g
  - Target: 约675g
  - Difference: 140g more than target, which is roughly 20% higher.
  - Is this ""大致相同""? 20% difference is quite large for a weight value measured approximately, but since ""约"" indicates approximation, let's consider if this is close enough.
  - 675g vs 815g: difference seems significant.
  - Considering normal rounding or approximation, 140g difference on 675g is large. Probably no.

- idx_1:
  - Response: 约645g
  - Target: 约705g
  - Difference: 60g less than target, around 8.5% difference.
  - 645g and 705g difference is smaller percentage than idx_0, but still a difference.
  - Given ""约"" implies approximation and criterion is lenient, this can be considered consistent.

- idx_2:
  - Response: 约655g
  - Target: 约675g
  - Difference: 20g less than target, about 3% difference.
  - Very close. Definitely counts as correct.

- idx_3:

### idx_0
- Response: ""64-256000""
- Target: ""iso64-25600""
- Analysis: The reference answer indicates an ISO range from 64 to 25600, and the response has an upper bound of 256000, which is an order of magnitude higher, possibly a typo or exaggeration. While the lower bound matches (64), the upper bound is wrong. It does not point to the same entity since it expands the ISO upper limit by a factor of 10, which is not roughly the same range.
- Verdict: Not semantically consistent, score = 0.

### idx_1
- Response: ""64-256000""
- Target: ""iso100-51200""
- Analysis: Response range is 64 to 256000; reference is 100 to 51200. Both lower and upper limits do not match (64 vs 100 lower, and 256000 vs 51200 upper). The ranges do not semantically match or point to the same entity. 256000 is much higher than 51200; 64 is lower than 100.
- Verdict: Semantic mismatch, score = 0.

### idx_2
- Response: ""64-25600""
- Target: ""iso100-51200""
- Analysis: Lower end in response is 64 vs 100 in target; upper end is 25600 vs 51200. Although the ranges don't exactly coincide, they partially overlap which could be considered roughly similar in certain contexts, but the criterion allows ""大致相同"" (roughly the same). Here the ranges are half or double of each other: lower and upper limits are different but still in the same ISO context. Since both refer to ISO ranges most likely, this can be considered pointing to the same entity roughly.
- Verdict: Semantic roughly consistent, score = 1.

### idx_3
- Response: ""64-25600""
- Target: ""iso100-51200""
- Analysis: The same as idx_2.
- Verdict: 1.

### idx_4
- Response: ""100-25600""
- Target: ""iso100-51200""
- Analysis: Lower limit matches exactly (100). Upper limit is 25600 vs 51200. These differ by a factor of 2, but the ranges still share the same domain context of ISO settings. Pointing to the same entity roughly.
- Verdict: 1.

参考答案涉及快门速度范围，重点是快门速度的最高和最低值，以及范围的合理性。评分依据是“语义相同大致、或者指向的实体一致即可”，括号内容未提及也算对，快门速度范围的上下限可以有一定微调（根据实际范围进行调整1/3或1/2EV步长调整），并且可以将30秒扩展到900秒。

对应关系中，response的快门速度范围为“1/4000s-30s+b”（假设“+b”是后续简写，忽略不影响评判），而参考答案分别是：

- idx_0、idx_1、idx_2、idx_3：标准答案快门速度最低是1/8000秒。
- idx_4：标准答案快门速度最低是1/4000秒。

逐项分析：

idx_0：  
response的范围是1/4000秒至30秒  
目标：1/8000至30秒（以1/3或1/2ev为步长微调），可理解为快门速度最低端是1/8000秒。但可根据实际范围进行调整，1/4000与1/8000差了一档，即1/2ev，属于允许的微调范围吗？快门速度范围允许上下微调1/3或1/2EV，1/4000相较于1/8000低档一档，即1/2 EV（一般会以1/3或1/2 EV调整，1/4000确实是1/3 EV或者1/2 EV的一挡），因此这属于合理范围内的调整，且最高速度和秒数吻合。括号内容是否涉及可忽略。故语义大致相同，分数1。

idx_1：   
同idx_0，唯一差别是括号里额外说明了m模式下可扩展至900s，response中未提及括号内容，根据评分标准，括号内容未提及也算对。快门速度范围的最低值“1/4000”相比参考答案的“1/8000”属于可接受范围内调整，最高值一样30秒。分数1。

idx_2：   
同idx_0，分析同上，分数1。

idx_3：   
同idx_0，分析同上，分数1。

idx_4：  
response的快门速度范围“1/4000s-30s+b” 和目标“1/4000至30秒（以1/3或1/2ev为步长进行微调）”。二者下限完全匹配，上限匹配，完全一致，括号内容忽略。分数1。
