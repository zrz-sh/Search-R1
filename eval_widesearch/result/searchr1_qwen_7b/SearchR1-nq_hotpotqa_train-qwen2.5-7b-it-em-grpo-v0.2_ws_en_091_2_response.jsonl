After reasoning, if you find you lack some knowledge, you can call a search engine by <search> query </search> and it will return the top searched results between <information> and </information>. You can search as many times as your want. If you find no further external knowledge needed, you can directly provide the answer inside <answer> and </answer>, without detailed illustrations. For example, <answer> Beijing </answer>. Question: It is said that \"Mom Su\" has saved AMD. Please help me sort out the specific processor (CPU) products released by AMD and their detailed information during the decade since Lisa Su became the CEO of AMD to 2023(include 2023). If individual information cannot be retrieved from the Internet, do not make up, just output \"NA\" in the corresponding cell. By the way, the core architechture of processor(CPU) should be Zen. And the core frequency uses the base clock.\n\nPlease output the sorted data in the format of one Markdown table. The column names in the table are: Time, Product Series, Processor Model, Core Architecture, Manufacturing Process (nm), Cores, Threads, Core Frequency (GHz), L2 Cache (MB), L3 Cache (MB), Graphics Model, Number of Graphics Cores.\n\nDon't ask me any questions, just output the results according to the column without omitting cells arbitrarily. The output format is:\n```markdown\n{data_content}\n```.\n\nEveryone says \"Su Ma\" saved AMD. Please help me compile a list of specific processor (CPU) products AMD has released since Lisa Su became CEO and launched the \"Zen\" architecture until 2024 (inclusive).
