Question: I would like to obtain information on the per capita health expenditure and life expectancy among residents of the five Nordic countries during the period 2020–2023 (including 2020 and 2023).\n\n Please present the compiled data in one Markdown table. The column headers, in order, should be: Country, Year, Per Capita Health Expenditure (EUR), Life Expectancy (Years), Domestic government health expenditure (% of GDP), Out-of-pocket expenditure (% of current health expenditure). If any data point cannot be found, please indicate it as NA.\n\nDon't ask me any questions, just output the results according to the column without omitting cells arbitrarily.
