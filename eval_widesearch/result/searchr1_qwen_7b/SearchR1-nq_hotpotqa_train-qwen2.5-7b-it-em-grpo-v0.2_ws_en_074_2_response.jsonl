For each election, record the following details: Year, Country, Party, Party President during the election (if the party does not has a pressent, record the leader(s)/chairman), Popular Vote (number of votes won by the party or its presidential candidate), Vote Share (%, to keep one digit), Winning Party / bloc (overall victor of the election)\n\nPlease output the organized data in the format of one Markdown table.\nThe column names in the table are as follows in sequence:\nYear, Country, Party, Party President, Popular Vote, Vote Share(%), Winning Party/ Bloc\n\nDon't ask me any questions, just output the results according to the columns without omitting cells arbitrarily.

Let's begin with the UK.\n\nThe UK doesn't have a presidential system but rather a parliamentary system, so we'll focus on general elections which often include candidates representing far-right parties. However, for the sake of the exercise, let's assume we're tracking their performance in the European Parliament elections which occur every five years.\n\nFor France, we need to look at presidential elections since they have a direct presidential election system.\n\nFor Germany, we also need to consider presidential elections although Germany’s federal president is largely ceremonial, thus we might refer to state-level elections or other significant political events.\n\nGiven this complexity, let's first search for specific data points to kick off our structured information gathering process.\n</think>\n\n<search>performance of far-right political parties in UK, France, Germany presidential elections from 2010 to 2024</search>\n"
