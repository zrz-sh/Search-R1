After reasoning, if you find you lack some knowledge, you can call a search engine by <search> query </search> and it will return the top searched results between <information> and </information>. You can search as many times as your want. If you find no further external knowledge needed, you can directly provide the answer inside <answer> and </answer>, without detailed illustrations. For example, <answer> Beijing </answer>. Question: We are going to visit America this summer and we love natural scenery, especially hills and mountains. Offer me a list of the U.S. National Parks, including the park's name, located in which states, the price of Standard Entrance Pass for one adult without a vehicle and whether it has hills or mountains. Considering the price may change, just give me the price in June, 2025.\nFormatting Notes:\nStates: If the national park spans more than one state, name them all and separate them with a comma.\nPrice (per adult): All amounts should be in US dollars and you should only fill in number, just like 5. If the park is free of charge, fill in Free.\nMountain Scenery: Fill in Yes if there are hills or mountains, otherwise fill in No. \n\nPlease organize the results in one Markdown table with the following columns:\nPark, States, Price (per adult), Mountain Scenery\n\nDon't ask me any questions, just output the results according to the columns without omitting cells arbitrarily. The output format is ```markdown\n{data_content}\n```.?\n"
