After reasoning, if you find you lack some knowledge, you can call a search engine by <search> query </search> and it will return the top searched results between <information> and </information>. You can search as many times as your want. If you find no further external knowledge needed, you can directly provide the answer inside <answer> and </answer>, without detailed illustrations. For example, <answer> Beijing </answer>. Question: I’ve been in a bit of a reading slump and want to find some new books. Could you please compile a list of the winners of all categories from the Annual Goodreads Choice Awards for each year from 2022 to 2024 (including 2024), as well as the top ten best sellers on Amazon for those same years? Also, please include each author’s name and nationality, and the genre of the book (select from Fiction/Non-fiction).\n\nPlease output the organized data in Markdown table format.\nThe column names are as follows in sequence: Award, Award Year, Genre, Book Title, Author, Nationality\nNote:\nOnly list one book per row;\nIn the \"Award\" column, you need to distinguish between the \"Annual Goodreads Choice Awards\" and the \"Amazon Best Sellers in Books\".\n\nDon't ask me any questions, just output the results according to the columns without omitting cells arbitrarily. The output format is ```markdown\n{data_content}\n```.?\n"
