I’m putting together a slick cheat sheet so we can geek out together.\nFor every season, could you list:\nthe season number, premiere date (Ep 1, YYYY-MM-DD), finale date (YYYY-MM-DD), total episode count, host(s), coaches line-up (separated by comma), Mega Mentor, winner’s name, winner’s final coach, winner’s Blind-Audition song, winner’s finale song, and the winning coach’s cumulative titles after that season. If it doesn't have a Mega Mentor, please enter 'N/A' into the table.\n\nPlease organize the results in one Markdown table with the following columns in order:\nSeason Number, Premiere Date(Ep 1, YYYY-MM-DD), Finale Date (YYYY-MM-DD), Total Episode Count, Host(s), Coaches Line-up, Mega Mentor, Winner, Winner’s Final Coach, Winner’s Blind-Audition Song, Winner’s Finale Song, Winning coach’s Cumulative Titles.\nDon't ask me any questions, just output the results according to the columns without omitting cells arbitrarily. The output format is ```markdown\n{data_content}\n```?\n"
