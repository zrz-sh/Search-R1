The time span is 2000-2023 (including 2000 and 2023).\nThe sorted information should include: film title, director, leading actress, year of premiere, distributor, and awards (only include the awards he won rather than any awards he was nominated for). By the way, please exclude anthology films, re-edited and re-released, and movies that he's dubbed.\n\nPlease output the sorted data in the format of one Markdown table. The column names in the table are as follows: Movie Title, Director, Leading Actress, Year of Premiere, Distributor, Awards.\nIf some information cannot be retrieved, please output \"-\".\nAwards only refer to the awards won by Tony Leung in this film.\n\nDon't ask me any questions, just output the results according to the columns without omitting cells arbitrarily. The output format is: \n ```markdown\n{data_content}\n```.?\n"
