Please help me find out which museums the London Pass currently provides free access to as of 2025. I need the museum, last entry time on weekends,  normal ticket price for one adult, and its specific address. I have no interest in sports so just skip the relevant museums.\n\nPlease present the information in one Markdown table with these column headers: Museum, Last Entry Time, Ticket Price (Pounds), and Address. \nFormat the \"Last Entry Time\" like \"4:00 pm\".\n\nDon't ask me any questions, just output the results according to the columns without omitting cells arbitrarily.
