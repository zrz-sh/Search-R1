**idx_0**  
- Response: ""arnoldaldrichwhite,paulj..."" (incomplete snippet, but the key point is the three astronaut names)  
- Target: ""thomasstafford,eugenecernan,johnyoung""  
- Analysis: The response lists different astronaut names than the target. They do not point to the same semantic entities. Thus, the response is not approximately the same as the target.

- Response: ""williamanders,johnyoung,james...""  
- Target: ""neila.armstrong,edwine.aldrinjr.,fredw.haisejr.""  
- Analysis: The response and target are lists of astronaut names. The response has William Anders and John Young; the target has Neil Armstrong, Edwin Aldrin Jr., and Fred W. Haise Jr. These do not overlap in persons or missions (at least the names differ significantly). So, semantically they do not point to the same entities.

### idx_0:
- **Response:** ""wallyschirra,donneisele,r""  
- **Target:** ""walterschirrajr.,r.waltercunningham,donnf.eisele""

Analysis:  
- ""wallyschirra"" matches ""walterschirrajr."" (phonetically and entity-wise Wally Schirra and Walter Schirra Jr.) - acceptable given spelling differences.  
- ""donneisele"" matches ""donnf.eisele"" (likely meant to be Donn Eisele) - approximates the same entity.  
- ""r"" versus ""r.waltercunningham"" — ""r"" alone is ambiguous and incomplete. The response should have named Walter Cunningham as per the target answer. Just ""r"" is insufficient to identify the entity.  
Because 2 of 3 astronauts partially match and 1 is incomplete/ambiguous, is this enough? The criterion says approximate semantics or pointing to the same entity is sufficient. Since ""r"" does not specify Walter Cunningham, this is incomplete.  
Verdict: The response does not fully match the target set of astronauts (3 required), but only 2 are identified while the third is ambiguous. The criterion does not explicitly say must match all entities, but since the response is incomplete for the third astronaut, we should consider this as an incorrect or incomplete answer. However, the criterion is lenient on misspellings but strict on identifying entities.

Thus: partial match but incomplete third entity → score 0.

---

### idx_1:
- **Response:** ""frankborman,jimlovell,alfred""  
- **Target:** ""frankborman,jameslovelljr.,williamanders""

Analysis:  
- ""frankborman"" exactly matches ""frankborman"".  
- ""jimlovell"" corresponds to ""jameslovelljr."" — Jim is a nickname for James Lovell Jr., so this points to the same entity.  
- ""alfred"" vs ""williamanders"" — Alfred is not the same as William Anders. This is a mismatch.  
Two astronauts identified correctly (names or nicknames), one incorrect.  
Since the question is about semantics pointing to the same entity, and two entities are correctly identified, the third is incorrect. The criterion does not say whether partial matches should get full credit or not. Usually, with 3 required names, missing one entity would mean the answer is incomplete.  
Thus: incomplete/partially correct. Score 0.

---

### idx_2:
- **Response:** ""neilarmstrong,edwinaldrinjr.""  
- **Target:** ""neilarmstrong,buzzaldrin,michaelcollins""

Analysis:  
- ""neilarmstrong"" matches exactly.  
- ""edwinaldrinjr."" corresponds to Buzz Aldrin (real name Edwin Aldrin Jr.)—correct.  
- Missing ""michaelcollins"" entirely.  
Only 2 of the 3 astronauts are named, missing the third. Criterion says approximate semantic equivalence and pointing to the same entity is sufficient for scoring. But missing one astronaut means answer is incomplete.  
Score 0 due to incompleteness.

---

### idx_3:
- **Response:** ""charlesconrad,josephkerwin,""  
- **Target:** ""/""

Analysis:  
- The target is ""/"" — possibly indicating no answer or no target entities.  
- The response gives two names: ""charlesconrad"", ""josephkerwin"".  
Since the target is empty or no valid answer, any response is probably extra and wrong or no answer expected.  
Criterion does not explicitly address this scenario, but generally, any answer where no entities are expected is incorrect.  
Score 0.

- Target: ""capekennedy,lc-34""
- Response: ""lc-34""

Analysis:  
- Response gives ""lc-34,"" which is part of the target (lc-34).
- The response correctly identifies a launch pad from Cape Kennedy.
- Since the criterion accepts approximate semantics/reference to same launch pad, this is correct.

Score: 1

---

### idx_1
- Target: ""capekennedy,lc-39a""
- Response: ""lc-37""

Analysis:  
- The response ""lc-37"" is a different launch pad number than ""lc-39a.""
- Even if different names are acceptable if referring to the same launch pad, lc-37 and lc-39a are two distinct launch pads at Cape Kennedy.
- Therefore, this response is incorrect.

Score: 0

---

### idx_2
- Target: ""capekennedy,lc-39a""
- Response: ""lc-39""

Analysis:  
- The response ""lc-39"" could refer to ""lc-39,"" which can be considered a general designation including ""lc-39a"" and ""lc-39b.""
- The target is ""lc-39a,"" a sub-pad of ""lc-39.""
- According to criterion, different names of the same launch pad are acceptable. Interpreting ""lc-39"" as meaning the same entity or referring to the pad ""lc-39a"" generally is acceptable.
- Thus, this can be considered correct.

Score: 1

**idx_0:**  
- Response: ""11days""  
- Target: ""10days,20hours,9minutes,3seconds""  
Analysis:  
The target is about slightly less than 11 days (10 days + 20 hours + 9 minutes + 3 seconds). The response is ""11 days"" which is close but not exactly the same. However, the criterion says approximate semantics or pointing to the same entity is sufficient.  
""11 days"" is a reasonable approximation, only less than a day's difference.

---

### idx_0
- Target: ""capekennedy,lc-34""
- Response: ""lc-34""

Analysis:  
- Response gives ""lc-34,"" which is part of the target (lc-34).
- The response correctly identifies a launch pad from Cape Kennedy.
- Since the criterion accepts approximate semantics/reference to same launch pad, this is correct.

Score: 1

---

### idx_1
- Target: ""capekennedy,lc-39a""
- Response: ""lc-37""

Analysis:  
- The response ""lc-37"" is a different launch pad number than ""lc-39a.""
- Even if different names are acceptable if referring to the same launch pad, lc-37 and lc-39a are two distinct launch pads at Cape Kennedy.
- Therefore, this response is incorrect.

Score: 0

---

### idx_2
- Target: ""capekennedy,lc-39a""
- Response: ""lc-39""

Analysis:  
- The response ""lc-39"" could refer to ""lc-39,"" which can be considered a general designation including ""lc-39a"" and ""lc-39b.""
- The target is ""lc-39a,"" a sub-pad of ""lc-39.""
- According to criterion, different names of the same launch pad are acceptable. Interpreting ""lc-39"" as meaning the same entity or referring to the pad ""lc-39a"" generally is acceptable.
- Thus, this can be considered correct.

Score: 1

### idx_0:
- **Response:** ""wallyschirra,donneisele,r""  
- **Target:** ""walterschirrajr.,r.waltercunningham,donnf.eisele""

Analysis:  
- ""wallyschirra"" matches ""walterschirrajr."" (phonetically and entity-wise Wally Schirra and Walter Schirra Jr.) - acceptable given spelling differences.  
- ""donneisele"" matches ""donnf.eisele"" (likely meant to be Donn Eisele) - approximates the same entity.  
- ""r"" versus ""r.waltercunningham"" — ""r"" alone is ambiguous and incomplete. The response should have named Walter Cunningham as per the target answer. Just ""r"" is insufficient to identify the entity.  
Because 2 of 3 astronauts partially match and 1 is incomplete/ambiguous, is this enough? The criterion says approximate semantics or pointing to the same entity is sufficient. Since ""r"" does not specify Walter Cunningham, this is incomplete.  
Verdict: The response does not fully match the target set of astronauts (3 required), but only 2 are identified while the third is ambiguous. The criterion does not explicitly say must match all entities, but since the response is incomplete for the third astronaut, we should consider this as an incorrect or incomplete answer. However, the criterion is lenient on misspellings but strict on identifying entities.

Thus: partial match but incomplete third entity → score 0.

---

### idx_1:
- **Response:** ""frankborman,jimlovell,alfred""  
- **Target:** ""frankborman,jameslovelljr.,williamanders""

Analysis:  
- ""frankborman"" exactly matches ""frankborman"".  
- ""jimlovell"" corresponds to ""jameslovelljr."" — Jim is a nickname for James Lovell Jr., so this points to the same entity.  
- ""alfred"" vs ""williamanders"" — Alfred is not the same as William Anders. This is a mismatch.  
Two astronauts identified correctly (names or nicknames), one incorrect.  
Since the question is about semantics pointing to the same entity, and two entities are correctly identified, the third is incorrect. The criterion does not say whether partial matches should get full credit or not. Usually, with 3 required names, missing one entity would mean the answer is incomplete.  
Thus: incomplete/partially correct. Score 0.

---

### idx_2:
- **Response:** ""neilarmstrong,edwinaldrinjr.""  
- **Target:** ""neilarmstrong,buzzaldrin,michaelcollins""

Analysis:  
- ""neilarmstrong"" matches exactly.  
- ""edwinaldrinjr."" corresponds to Buzz Aldrin (real name Edwin Aldrin Jr.)—correct.  
- Missing ""michaelcollins"" entirely.  
Only 2 of the 3 astronauts are named, missing the third. Criterion says approximate semantic equivalence and pointing to the same entity is sufficient for scoring. But missing one astronaut means answer is incomplete.  
Score 0 due to incompleteness.

---

### idx_3:
- **Response:** ""charlesconrad,josephkerwin,""  
- **Target:** ""/""

Analysis:  
- The target is ""/"" — possibly indicating no answer or no target entities.  
- The response gives two names: ""charlesconrad"", ""josephkerwin"".  
Since the target is empty or no valid answer, any response is probably extra and wrong or no answer expected.  
Criterion does not explicitly address this scenario, but generally, any answer where no entities are expected is incorrect.  
Score 0.

All responses fail to match fully or have incomplete or invalid entities. Therefore, all should be scored 0.

- ""as-204"" generally refers to Apollo-Saturn 204, a specific spacecraft/test flight mission designation.  
- ""saturn-ib"" is a rocket type/launch vehicle model.  
- The two terms do not point to the same entity nor are semantically equivalent.  

Score: 0

---

**idx_1**  
- Response: ""saturnv""  
- Target: ""thesaturnvvehicle""  

Analysis:  
- ""saturnv"" and ""thesaturnvvehicle"" clearly refer to the same rocket, the Saturn V vehicle.  
- The response is slightly abbreviated but clearly indicates the same entity.  
- This meets the criterion of approximate semantic equivalence.  

Score: 1

---

**idx_2**  
- Response: ""saturnv""  
- Target: ""saturnvspacevehicle""  

Analysis:  
- Both ""saturnv"" and ""saturnvspacevehicle"" refer to the same vehicle (Saturn V space vehicle).  
- Response matches the reference sufficiently in semantics.  

Score: 1

---

**idx_3**  
- Response: ""skylabt-2""  
- Target: ""saturn-ivb""  

Analysis:  
- ""skylabt-2"" presumably means Skylab Test-2 or similar, a space station or test mission.  
- ""saturn-ivb"" is a rocket stage/vehicle model.  
- The entities are different.  
- Not semantically equivalent or referring to the same entity.

,,1973-05-14,1973-05-14,0.0,"Let's analyze each idx pair according to the criterion and the provided responses and targets:

**Criterion:**  
- It is sufficient if the semantics are approximately the same as the reference answer or if they point to the same entity.  
- No need for word-for-word correspondence.

---

**idx_0**  
- Response: ""arnoldaldrichwhite,paulj..."" (incomplete snippet, but the key point is the three astronaut names)  
- Target: ""thomasstafford,eugenecernan,johnyoung""  
- Analysis: The response lists different astronaut names than the target. They do not point to the same semantic entities. Thus, the response is not approximately the same as the target.  
- Score: 0

---

**idx_1**  
- Response: ""williamanders,johnyoung,james...""  
- Target: ""neila.armstrong,edwine.aldrinjr.,fredw.haisejr.""  
- Analysis: The response and target are lists of astronaut names. The response has William Anders and John Young; the target has Neil Armstrong, Edwin Aldrin Jr., and Fred W. Haise Jr. These do not overlap in persons or missions (at least the names differ significantly). So, semantically they do not point to the same entities.  
- Score: 0

---

**idx_2**  
- Response: ""michaelcollins,gusgrissom,roger""  
- Target: ""jamesa.lovelljr.,williama.anders,fredw.haisejr.""  
- Analysis: The response names Michael Collins, Gus Grissom, Roger (likely Roger Chaffee). The target is James A. Lovell Jr., William A. Anders, Fred W. Haise Jr. The listed astronauts are from different missions and different people. So they do not point to the same entities.  
- Score: 0

---

**idx_3**  
- Response: ""williampogue,owengarriott,gerald""  
- Target: ""/"" (empty or not applicable)  
- Analysis: Target is ""/"", presumably meaning no target or no answer given. With no target to compare to, scoring has no meaning. Since criterion says semantics should be approximately the same, with no target, the response cannot earn a score of 1.  
- Score: 0

### idx_0:
- **Response:** ""wallyschirra,donneisele,r""  
- **Target:** ""walterschirrajr.,r.waltercunningham,donnf.eisele""

Analysis:  
- ""wallyschirra"" matches ""walterschirrajr."" (phonetically and entity-wise Wally Schirra and Walter Schirra Jr.) - acceptable given spelling differences.  
- ""donneisele"" matches ""donnf.eisele"" (likely meant to be Donn Eisele) - approximates the same entity.  
- ""r"" versus ""r.waltercunningham"" — ""r"" alone is ambiguous and incomplete. The response should have named Walter Cunningham as per the target answer. Just ""r"" is insufficient to identify the entity.  
Because 2 of 3 astronauts partially match and 1 is incomplete/ambiguous, is this enough? The criterion says approximate semantics or pointing to the same entity is sufficient. Since ""r"" does not specify Walter Cunningham, this is incomplete.  
Verdict: The response does not fully match the target set of astronauts (3 required), but only 2 are identified while the third is ambiguous. The criterion does not explicitly say must match all entities, but since the response is incomplete for the third astronaut, we should consider this as an incorrect or incomplete answer. However, the criterion is lenient on misspellings but strict on identifying entities.

Thus: partial match but incomplete third entity → score 0.

---

### idx_1:
- **Response:** ""frankborman,jimlovell,alfred""  
- **Target:** ""frankborman,jameslovelljr.,williamanders""

Analysis:  
- ""frankborman"" exactly matches ""frankborman"".  
- ""jimlovell"" corresponds to ""jameslovelljr."" — Jim is a nickname for James Lovell Jr., so this points to the same entity.  
- ""alfred"" vs ""williamanders"" — Alfred is not the same as William Anders. This is a mismatch.  
Two astronauts identified correctly (names or nicknames), one incorrect.  
Since the question is about semantics pointing to the same entity, and two entities are correctly identified, the third is incorrect. The criterion does not say whether partial matches should get full credit or not. Usually, with 3 required names, missing one entity would mean the answer is incomplete.  
Thus: incomplete/partially correct. Score 0.

---

### idx_2:
- **Response:** ""neilarmstrong,edwinaldrinjr.""  
- **Target:** ""neilarmstrong,buzzaldrin,michaelcollins""

Analysis:  
- ""neilarmstrong"" matches exactly.  
- ""edwinaldrinjr."" corresponds to Buzz Aldrin (real name Edwin Aldrin Jr.)—correct.  
- Missing ""michaelcollins"" entirely.  
Only 2 of the 3 astronauts are named, missing the third. Criterion says approximate semantic equivalence and pointing to the same entity is sufficient for scoring. But missing one astronaut means answer is incomplete.  
Score 0 due to incompleteness.

---

### idx_3:
- **Response:** ""charlesconrad,josephkerwin,""  
- **Target:** ""/""

Analysis:  
- The target is ""/"" — possibly indicating no answer or no target entities.  
- The response gives two names: ""charlesconrad"", ""josephkerwin"".  
Since the target is empty or no valid answer, any response is probably extra and wrong or no answer expected.  
Criterion does not explicitly address this scenario, but generally, any answer where no entities are expected is incorrect.  
Score 0.

---

### Summary:
All responses fail to match fully or have incomplete or invalid entities. Therefore, all should be scored 0.

### idx_0  
- Response: ""atlanticocean""  
- Target: ""northatlanticocean""  
Analysis:  
- ""atlanticocean"" is a broader term referring to the entire Atlantic Ocean, while ""northatlanticocean"" is a specific part of it.  
- Since the response is not wrong and roughly corresponds to the same entity (Atlantic Ocean), this satisfies the criterion.  
- Score: 1

### idx_1  
- Response: ""southpacificocean""  
- Target: ""northpacificocean""  
Analysis:  
- Response indicates the southern part of the Pacific Ocean, target is the northern part.  
- Different parts of the Pacific Ocean, although they belong to the same ocean, these are distinct entities.  
- The response and target refer to different specific entities.  
- Does not meet the criterion of approximately the same semantics or pointing to the same entity.  
- Score: 0

### idx_0
- Target: ""capekennedy,lc-34""
- Response: ""lc-34""

Analysis:  
- Response gives ""lc-34,"" which is part of the target (lc-34).
- The response correctly identifies a launch pad from Cape Kennedy.
- Since the criterion accepts approximate semantics/reference to same launch pad, this is correct.

Score: 1

---

### idx_1
- Target: ""capekennedy,lc-39a""
- Response: ""lc-37""

Analysis:  
- The response ""lc-37"" is a different launch pad number than ""lc-39a.""
- Even if different names are acceptable if referring to the same launch pad, lc-37 and lc-39a are two distinct launch pads at Cape Kennedy.
- Therefore, this response is incorrect.

Score: 0

---

### idx_2
- Target: ""capekennedy,lc-39a""
- Response: ""lc-39""

Analysis:  
- The response ""lc-39"" could refer to ""lc-39,"" which can be considered a general designation including ""lc-39a"" and ""lc-39b.""
- The target is ""lc-39a,"" a sub-pad of ""lc-39.""
- According to criterion, different names of the same launch pad are acceptable. Interpreting ""lc-39"" as meaning the same entity or referring to the pad ""lc-39a"" generally is acceptable.
- Thus, this can be considered correct.

Score: 1
