""It is sufficient if the semantics are approximately the same as the reference answer or if they point to the same entity.""

In this task, it seems the ""response"" is an answer to a question, and ""target"" is the reference correct answer. We consider a response correct (score=1) if it points to the same entity as the target, regardless of minor spelling or formatting differences.

Criterion:  
""It is sufficient if the semantics are approximately the same as the reference answer or if they point to the same entity.""

In this task, it seems the ""response"" is an answer to a question, and ""target"" is the reference correct answer. We consider a response correct (score=1) if it points to the same entity as the target, regardless of minor spelling or formatting differences.

Criterion summary:  
- The semantics must be approximately the same or the response and target should point to the same entity.  
- No need for word-for-word match; identity of player/entity is what matters.  

We consider the response correct (score=1) if the response and target are the same player/entity.
