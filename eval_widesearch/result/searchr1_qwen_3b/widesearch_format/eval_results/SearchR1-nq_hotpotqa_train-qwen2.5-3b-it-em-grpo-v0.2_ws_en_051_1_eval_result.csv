Criterion: It is sufficient if the semantics are approximately the same as the reference answer or if they point to the same entity. No need for word-for-word match.

---

**idx_0**

- Response: ""9th-12th""  
- Target: ""grades9-12""

Analysis:  
The response ""9th-12th"" corresponds exactly to the grades 9 through 12, which is semantically the same as ""grades9-12"". Even if the wording differs (e.g., ""grades9-12"" vs ""9th-12th""), the meaning is equivalent (same grade range).

Score: 1

---

**idx_1**

- Response: ""9th-12th""  
- Target: ""grades5-12""

Analysis:  
The target covers ""grades5-12"", which is grades 5 through 12 inclusive. The response only specifies ""9th-12th"", so it excludes grades 5-8. Therefore, the response only partially matches the target but does not cover the full range.

According to the criterion, answers should be approximately the same semantics or point to the same entity. Here the response is a subset of the target, so the semantics are not equivalent. The response is incomplete.

We have two items to score:

1. idx_0:
   - Response: ""nan""
   - Target (standard answer): ""1.0""
   - The response is ""nan"", which is usually interpreted as ""not a number"" or no valid answer.
   - The standard answer is ""1.0"".
   - They clearly do not match in meaning or entity.
   - According to the criteria, the semantics must be approximately the same or point to the same entity.
   - Here, ""nan"" does not correspond semantically or entity-wise to ""1.0"".
   - Therefore, score = 0.

2. idx_1:
   - Response: ""nan""
