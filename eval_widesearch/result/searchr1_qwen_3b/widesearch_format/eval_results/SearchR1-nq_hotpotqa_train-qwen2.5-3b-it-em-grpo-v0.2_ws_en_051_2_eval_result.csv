**Criterion:**  
- It is sufficient if the semantics are approximately the same as the reference answer or if they point to the same entity.  
- No need for word-for-word correspondence.

---

### Pair idx_0

- **Response:** ""9thgrade""  
- **Target:** ""grades9-12""

**Analysis:**  
- The target includes a range of grades from 9 to 12.  
- The response only mentions ""9thgrade"".  
- The response points only to the 9th grade, which is just one part of the target answer.  
- The response does not cover grades 10-12, which are part of the target.  
- The semantics are not approximately the same because the target is a range (9-12) and the response is a single grade (9).  
- Since the response covers only a subset and not the entire range, it is incomplete relative to the target.

**Judgment:**  
Score = 0

---

### Pair idx_1

- **Response:** ""9thgrade""  
- **Target:** ""grades5-12""

**Analysis:**  
- The target is a range from grade 5 to grade 12.  
- The response only mentions ""9thgrade"", which is one single grade within the range.  
- The response is far narrower than the target range.  
- The semantics do not cover the whole range or approximate it.  
- The response points to a single grade within the target range, but since the target references a broader scope (grades 5-12), the response is insufficient to cover the full target.

**Judgment:**  
Score = 0

}
```",grades9-12,9thgrade,0.0,"Let's analyze each item according to the criterion:

Criterion summary:  
- Semantics approximately the same as the reference answer or point to the same entity → score 1.  
- Otherwise → score 0.  
- Score must be either 0 or 1.

Items:  
1. idx_0:  
- Response = ""nan""  
- Target = ""1.0""  
Analysis:  
- Response ""nan"" is not semantically same as ""1.0"" nor points to the same entity. ""nan"" usually means ""not a number,"" so it is not an answer matching ""1.0"".  
- Therefore, score = 0.

2. idx_1:  
- Response = ""nan""  
- Target = ""6.0""  
Analysis:  
- Same as above, ""nan"" does not correspond semantically or entity-wise to ""6.0"".
