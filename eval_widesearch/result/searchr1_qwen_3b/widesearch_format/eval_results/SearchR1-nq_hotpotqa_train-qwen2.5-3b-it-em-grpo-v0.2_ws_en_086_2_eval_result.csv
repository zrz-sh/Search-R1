- idx_0  
  - Target answer: ""yg""  
  - Response: ""ygentertainment""

  According to the criterion, the semantics need to be approximately the same or pointing to the same entity. ""yg"" is an abbreviation or short form commonly used for ""YG Entertainment,"" which is a well-known company/entity. The response ""ygentertainment"" clearly points to the same entity as ""yg"", just more complete.

Therefore, the response is semantically consistent with the target and meets the criterion.

**Score: 1**

```json
{
    ""idx_0"": 1
}
```",yg,ygentertainment,1.0,"Let's analyze the response against the standard answer using the given criterion:

- Standard answer (target): ""blackpink""
- Response: ""blackpink""

Criterion states: ""It is sufficient if the semantics are approximately the same as the reference answer or if they point to the same entity. There is no need for a word-for-word correspondence.""

Analysis:
- The response exactly matches the standard answer.
- The response correctly points to the same entity as the target.

Based on this, the response is completely correct.

Final score for idx_0: 1

{
    ""idx_0"": 1

```",blackpink,blackpink,1.0,"Let's analyze the response for idx_0:

- Target answers list multiple song titles:

  1. killthislove
  2. don'tknowwhattodo
  3. kickit
  4. hopenot
  5. ddu-duddu-du

- The response is ""killthislove"".

- According to the criterion, it is sufficient if the semantics are approximately the same or if they point to the same entity as any of the target answers.

- The main part of the song title should be consistent; differences such as ""remix"" or ""ver"" are not to be distinguished.

- The response ""killthislove"" exactly matches the first song title in the target list.

- Therefore, the response is a correct answer matching one of the target song titles.
