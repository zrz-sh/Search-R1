Criterion: Semantics are considered correct if the response points approximately to the same entities as the target. Exact word matching is not necessary.

---

### idx_0

- **Target**: lindseyberg, robynahmow-santos, tayyibahaneef-park, cassandrabusse, nancymetcalf, katherinewilkins, theresecrawford, daniellescott-arruda, elisabethbachman, jennifertamas, sarahdrurypetkovic, nicoledavis
- **Response**: '-'

Analysis: The response is a hyphen indicating likely ""no answer"" or ""empty"". The target lists multiple entities. The response fails completely to point to any of the entities.

Score: 0

---

### idx_1

- **Target**: lindseyberg, robynahmow-santos, janecollymore, tayyibahaneef-park, nancymetcalf, shondacole, kristinhildebrand, elisabethbachman, elishathomas, jennifertamas, sarahdrurypetkovic, nicoledavis
- **Response**: kerigibson, nicolefawcett, bethaniemattek-sands, laurasummers, ashleyhunter, laurenstorniolo, kellyclaar, jenniferward-levitas, lindseyberg, morganhurd, lindseyhoran, lindseyschaefer

Analysis: Check overlap names between response and target.

- Overlap: lindseyberg (exists in both)

- Other names in the target do not appear in the response.

- Response includes other people (kerigibson, etc.) not in target.

Since the criterion says ""semantics approximately same"" or pointing to the same entity is sufficient.

Here, only 1 out of 12 target entities appears in response (lindseyberg).

Is this enough?

Given the criterion, partial overlap is acceptable, but the response should be pointing at approximately the same semantics or entities.

Only one entity overlaps, but the rest are different. The response doesn't cover the main entities.

But since the criterion states semantics ""approximately the same"" or pointing to the same entity is sufficient.

Does inclusion of one target entity count for full marks?

The instruction is vague, but since the scoring is only 0 or 1, and ""approximately the same"" implies good coverage or strong overlap.

One overlapping entity out of many is weak. This is more like a partial match. So presumably 0.

Score: 0

---

### idx_2

- **Target**: '-'

- **Response**: kerigibson, nicolefawcett, bethaniemattek-sands, laurasummers, ashleyhunter, laurenstorniolo, kellyclaar, jenniferward-levitas, lindseyberg, morganhurd, lindseyhoran, lindseyschaefer

Analysis: Target is '-', presumably empty or no entities.

Response includes many names.

Criterion says semantics approximately the same or point to same entity.

Here response is a completely different answer when target is empty.

Score: 0

---

### idx_3

- **Target**: lindseyberg, robynahmow-santos, tayyibahaneef-park, ogonnannamani, kimberlyglass, kimwilloughby, logantom, daniellescott-arruda, heatherbown, jennifertamas, stacysykora, nicoledavis

Analysis: No overlap of names between response and target.

Given zero intersection.
