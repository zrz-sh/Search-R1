,,healinghearts,Healing Hearts,1.0,"Let's analyze each idx pair step-by-step according to the provided grading criterion:

Criterion summary:  
- Semantics must be approximately the same or point to the same entity.  
- No need for word-for-word matching.  
- Score is either 0 or 1.

---

### idx_0  
- Response: ""nan""  
- Target: ""-""  
Explanation: Both indicate no meaningful content or ""none"". ""nan"" is often interpreted as ""not a number"" or no answer. Similarly, ""-"" can mean no data or no awards. These have the same implication: no answer. According to the criterion, semantics are approximately the same.

  - ""200053thcannesfilmfestivalbestactor""  
  - ""200120thhongkongfilmawardsbestactor""  
  - ""the1stchinesefilmmediaawardsbestactor""

Explanation:  
The target lists three different awards: Cannes Film Festival Best Actor, Hong Kong Film Awards Best Actor, Chinese Film Media Awards Best Actor. The response only states ""hongkongfilmaward"" (singular, and somewhat generic without year or ""best actor"" explicitly). At least ""hongkongfilmaward"" corresponds roughly to the second target item ""200120thhongkongfilmawardsbestactor."" So the response points to one of the target awards but does not mention the other two. The criterion says ""it is sufficient if semantics are approximately the same or point to the same entity."" This seems acceptable since the response points to one of the exact target awards.

### idx_0  
- Response: ""nan""  
- Target: ""-""  
Explanation: Both indicate no meaningful content or ""none"". ""nan"" is often interpreted as ""not a number"" or no answer. Similarly, ""-"" can mean no data or no awards. These have the same implication: no answer. According to the criterion, semantics are approximately the same.

  - ""the1stchinesefilmmediaawardsbestactor""

Explanation:  
The target lists three different awards: Cannes Film Festival Best Actor, Hong Kong Film Awards Best Actor, Chinese Film Media Awards Best Actor. The response only states ""hongkongfilmaward"" (singular, and somewhat generic without year or ""best actor"" explicitly). At least ""hongkongfilmaward"" corresponds roughly to the second target item ""200120thhongkongfilmawardsbestactor."" So the response points to one of the target awards but does not mention the other two. The criterion says ""it is sufficient if semantics are approximately the same or point to the same entity.""
