Criterion summary: Semantic equivalence or pointing to the same entity is sufficient. No need for exact word-for-word matches.

**Pair idx_0:**

- Response: ""china""
- Target: ""china""

Analysis: The response matches the target exactly, hence perfectly conveying the intended meaning.

Score: 1

**Pair idx_1:**

Analysis: Same as above. Exact match.

**idx_0:**  
- Response: ""3rd""

- Analysis: ""3rd"" indicates a placement (third place), while ""championofteamevent"" indicates the first place or winner. These are not semantically equivalent or pointing to the same entity. Hence, score = 0.

While 2nd place might usually advance to semifinals, the response does not directly state advancing or the phase; it only indicates a placement. Since semantics do not approximately match or point to the same entity explicitly, score = 0.
