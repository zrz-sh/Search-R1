Criterion summary:  
- The semantics should be approximately the same or point to the same entity.  
- Different regions have wines of different specifications, so the capacity does not need to be exactly matched. This suggests that a small difference in volume (like 70cl vs 750ml) is acceptable since 70cl is effectively 700ml, close to 750ml, and thus considered approximately the same entity.

Note also that 1cl = 10ml, so 70cl = 700ml. The target answers are mostly 750ml, except idx_3 (700ml) and idx_4 (multiple sizes).

Now let's check each idx:

- idx_0:

Criterion summary:  
- The semantics should be approximately the same or point to the same entity.  
- Different regions have wines of different specifications, so the capacity does not need to be exactly matched. This suggests that a small difference in volume (like 70cl vs 750ml) is acceptable since 70cl is effectively 700ml, close to 750ml, and thus considered approximately the same entity.

Note also that 1cl = 10ml, so 70cl = 700ml. The target answers are mostly 750ml, except idx_3 (700ml) and idx_4 (multiple sizes).

Now let's check each idx:

- idx_0:

- The semantics should be approximately the same or point to the same entity.  
- Different regions have wines of different specifications, so the capacity does not need to be exactly matched. This suggests that a small difference in volume (like 70cl vs 750ml) is acceptable since 70cl is effectively 700ml, close to 750ml, and thus considered approximately the same entity.

Note also that 1cl = 10ml, so 70cl = 700ml. The target answers are mostly 750ml, except idx_3 (700ml) and idx_4 (multiple sizes).

Now let's check each idx:

- idx_0:  
  response = 70cl → 700ml approx  
  target = 750ml  
  700ml vs 750ml is close and the criterion says approximately same semantics okay.  
  Score: 1

- idx_1:  
  Same as idx_0, 70cl vs 750ml → 1

- idx_2:  
  Same as idx_0, 70cl vs 750ml → 1

- idx_3:  
  response = 70cl (700ml)  
  target = 700ml  
  Exactly the same volume here.  
  Score:1

- idx_4:  
  response = 70cl (700ml)  
  target = multiple values: 50ml/200ml/375ml/750ml/1000ml/1750ml  
  700ml is close to 750ml in the target list, so response points to the same entity.  
  Score:1

- idx_5:  
  70cl vs 750ml → same as idx_0, accepted → 1

- idx_6:  
  70cl vs 750ml → 1

- idx_7:  
  70cl vs 750ml → 1

All responses roughly match or approximate their targets well within the accepted range.

### Analysis of each pair:

**idx_0**  
- Response: ""core""

- Result: 0

**idx_5**  
- Response: ""core""  
- Target: ""premiumvodka""  
- Although ""core"" is general, the criterion states that a broader response of vodka is accepted if the target is premium vodka. But ""core"" does not explicitly imply vodka or anything at all. It's just an adjective and gives no specific type or entity matching.

Response: ""40""

Analysis:  
- ""blendedscotchwhisky"" is a compound term combining ""blended,"" ""scotch,"" and ""whisky.""  
- It clearly points to a type of whisky.  
- The criterion states that approximate semantic equivalence or pointing to the same entity suffices.  
- Since ""blendedscotchwhisky"" is a specific type of whisky, it should be accepted as correct.
