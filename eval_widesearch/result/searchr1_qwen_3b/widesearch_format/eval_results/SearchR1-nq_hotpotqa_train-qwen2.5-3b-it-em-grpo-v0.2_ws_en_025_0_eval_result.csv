**idx_0**  
- Response: ""304fultonst,fresno,ca93704""  
- Target: ""650n.fultonstreet,fresno,ca93728""  
Analysis:  
- The street numbers are different (304 vs. 650).  
- The street names are approximately the same (fultonst vs. fultonstreet).  
- The ZIP codes are different (93704 vs. 93728).  
- The city and state are the same (fresno, ca).  
However, since the street numbers and ZIP codes differ, these addresses likely point to different locations. The criterion requires that the semantics be approximately the same or refer to the same entity, which is not the case here.  
Score: 0

**idx_1**  
- Response: ""1300sfresnost,fresno,ca93706""  
- Target: ""165northclarkstreet,fresno,ca93701""  
Analysis:  
- Street number: 1300s vs. 165  
- Street name: fresnost vs. northclarkstreet (completely different street names)  
- City, state: fresno, ca (same)  
- ZIP code differs: 93706 vs. 93701  
Because both street name and number differ significantly and the ZIP differs, these are different locations.  
Score: 0

**idx_2**  
- Response: ""165nclarkst,fresno,ca93701""  
- Target: ""165northclarkstreet,fresno,ca93701""  
Analysis:  
- The street number is the same (165)  
- The street name is the same but abbreviated (nclarkst vs northclarkstreet)  
- City, state, and ZIP code are identical.  
The semantics match and clearly refer to the same entity.
