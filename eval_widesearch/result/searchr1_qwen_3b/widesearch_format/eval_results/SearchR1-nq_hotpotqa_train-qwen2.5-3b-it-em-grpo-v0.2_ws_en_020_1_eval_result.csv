**idx_0**

Analysis: Response gives ""puebla"" (a Mexican state); target lists two cities ""cuicatlán"" and ""tehuacán"" but no province/state explicitly.  
The two cities cuicatlán and tehuacán are both in Puebla state. So response points to the province which encompasses both cities — acceptable per criteria since the main city or county is required but ""province only no"" — however, here the target lists only cities and no province.  
The criteria states: ""for a specific location, main city/county required, only province is not enough."" Here, response: province only, target: two cities (both in Puebla)  
Since multiple locations present, response must include both or main city or county — response gives just province, target cities. Not matching multiple addresses nor specific enough.

**idx_0**  
- Response: ""alberta""

Analysis: The response only gives the province ""alberta,"" but the target includes a county ""countyofnewell"" within Alberta.  
Criteria says province alone is not enough for a specific location, and county is required. Response misses ""countyofnewell.""  
Score: 0

**idx_1**  
- Response: ""alberta,britishcolumbia""

**idx_2**  
- Response: ""newfoundlandandlabrador""

Score: 0

**idx_4**

Score: 0

- Response: ""campeche""  
- Target: ""calakmul,campeche""  
Analysis: Province given; target also has ""calakmul"" (municipality or region). Province only insufficient.  
Score: 0

**idx_6**  
- Response: ""puebla""  
- Target: ""cuicatlán,tehuacán""  
Analysis: Response gives ""puebla"" (a Mexican state); target lists two cities ""cuicatlán"" and ""tehuacán"" but no province/state explicitly.  
The two cities cuicatlán and tehuacán are both in Puebla state. So response points to the province which encompasses both cities — acceptable per criteria since the main city or county is required but ""province only no"" — however, here the target lists only cities and no province.  
The criteria states: ""for a specific location, main city/county required, only province is not enough."" Here, response: province only, target: two cities (both in Puebla)  
Since multiple locations present, response must include both or main city or county — response gives just province, target cities. Not matching multiple addresses nor specific enough.

Analysis: Response gives ""puebla"" (a Mexican state); target lists two cities ""cuicatlán"" and ""tehuacán"" but no province/state explicitly.  
The two cities cuicatlán and tehuacán are both in Puebla state. So response points to the province which encompasses both cities — acceptable per criteria since the main city or county is required but ""province only no"" — however, here the target lists only cities and no province.  
The criteria states: ""for a specific location, main city/county required, only province is not enough."" Here, response: province only, target: two cities (both in Puebla)

---

**idx_0**  
- Response: ""alberta""  
- Target: ""countyofnewell,alberta""  
Analysis: The response only gives the province ""alberta,"" but the target includes a county ""countyofnewell"" within Alberta.  
Criteria says province alone is not enough for a specific location, and county is required. Response misses ""countyofnewell.""  
Score: 0

**idx_1**  
- Response: ""alberta,britishcolumbia""  
- Target: ""albertaandbritishcolumbia""  
Analysis: The response correctly lists both provinces Alberta and British Columbia. The target is combined but refers to the same two provinces.  
Both names correspond, all multiple locations match.  
Score: 1

**idx_2**  
- Response: ""newfoundlandandlabrador""  
- Target: ""rockyharbour,newfoundlandandlabrador,canada""

**idx_3**

Analysis: Province given; target also has ""calakmul"" (municipality or region). Province only insufficient.  
Score: 0

**idx_6**  
- Response: ""puebla""  
- Target: ""cuicatlán,tehuacán""  
Analysis: Response gives ""puebla"" (a Mexican state); target lists two cities ""cuicatlán"" and ""tehuacán"" but no province/state explicitly.  
The two cities cuicatlán and tehuacán are both in Puebla state. So response points to the province which encompasses both cities — acceptable per criteria since the main city or county is required but ""province only no"" — however, here the target lists only cities and no province.  
The criteria states: ""for a specific location, main city/county required, only province is not enough."" Here, response: province only, target: two cities (both in Puebla)  
Since multiple locations present, response must include both or main city or county — response gives just province, target cities. Not matching multiple addresses nor specific enough.
