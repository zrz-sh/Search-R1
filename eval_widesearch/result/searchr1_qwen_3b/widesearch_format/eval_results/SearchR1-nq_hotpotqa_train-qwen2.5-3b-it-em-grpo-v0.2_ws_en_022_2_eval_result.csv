All responses have response: '-' which means the response is essentially empty or no answer given.

According to the grading criterion:

- It suffices to match one or more names from the reference answer.
- It is enough if the semantics approximately match or point to the same entity.
- A response of ""-"" does not have any information.

Therefore, for each idx:

- Response is '-', no match with the target.
- No relevant information provided.
- So, score should be 0 for each.

All responses have response: '-' which means the response is essentially empty or no answer given.

The targets are lists of names (artists, producers, songwriters, etc.).

According to the grading criterion:

- It suffices to match one or more names from the reference answer.
- It is enough if the semantics approximately match or point to the same entity.
- A response of ""-"" does not have any information.

Therefore, for each idx:

- Response is '-', no match with the target.
- No relevant information provided.
- So, score should be 0 for each.
