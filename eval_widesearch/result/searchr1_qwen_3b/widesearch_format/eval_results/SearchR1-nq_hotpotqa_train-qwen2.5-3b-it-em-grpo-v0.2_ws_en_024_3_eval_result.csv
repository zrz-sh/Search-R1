Criterion:  
- It is sufficient if the semantics are approximately the same as the reference answer or if they point to the same entity. No word-for-word match required.

Analysis:  
- idx_0: response = ""coldstonecreamery"", target = ""e-trade""  
  Different entities. No semantic match. Score = 0

- idx_1: response = ""pepsi"", target = ""e-trade""

Summary: None of the responses matches or points to the same entity as their targets. Hence all 0.
