plannedparenthood-fultonstreethealthcenter,Planned Parenthood,,,1.0,key_match,1.0,"exact match, response: fresno, target: fresno",fresno,fresno,1.0,"Let's analyze the response against the target based on the given criterion:

- Target: ""650n.fultonstreet,fresno,ca93728""
- Response: ""650n.fultonstreetfresno,ca93728usa""

Step-by-step analysis:

1. The address number and street name ""650n.fultonstreet"" appear exactly in both.
2. The city ""fresno"" is present in both.
3. The postal code ""ca93728"" is present in both. Note that ""ca"" appears to be part of the state abbreviation, but it appears in both responses.
4. The response adds ""usa"" at the end, which is an extra but does not alter the correctness of the answer.
5. The response lacks a comma between ""street"" and ""fresno"" (""fultonstreetfresno"" vs ""fultonstreet,fresno""), but the criterion states that word-for-word isn't necessary as long as the semantics match. This seems acceptable.
6. Overall, the response points to the same address entity as the target.

Therefore, the response can be considered completely correct.

- The target (standard answer) is: ""8am-4:30pm""
- The response is: ""closed""

According to the grading criterion:
- The response should have approximately the same semantics or point to the same entity.
- ""closed"" means not open, no operating hours.
- ""8am-4:30pm"" clearly indicates specific opening hours.
- The two do not have approximately the same meaning; one indicates hours of operation, the other indicates no operation.
- Therefore, the semantics do not match or point to the same entity.
