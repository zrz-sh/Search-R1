plannedparenthood-fultonstreethealthcenter,Planned Parenthood,,,1.0,key_match,1.0,"exact match, response: fresno, target: fresno",fresno,fresno,0.0,"Let me analyze the pair item by item according to the provided criterion.

**Item idx_0:**  
- Standard answer (target): ""650n.fultonstreet,fresno,ca93728""  
- Response: ""2364fultonstreet,fresno,ca93701""

**Analysis:**  
- The street numbers differ (650n vs 2364).  
- The street name is similar (""fultonstreet"" in both).  
- The city is the same (fresno).  
- The state abbreviation is the same (ca).  
- The zip codes are different (93728 vs 93701).

The criterion states:  
""It is sufficient if the semantics are approximately the same as the reference answer or if they point to the same entity.""  

The addresses here are different locations (different street numbers and zip codes). They do not point to the same entity. The semantics are not approximately the same, as the street number and zip code differ significantly, indicating a different address.

**Conclusion:** The response does not meet the criterion well enough, so the score is 0.

- Standard answer for idx_0: ""8am-4:30pm""
- Response for idx_0: ""closed""

According to the criterion, the response should have approximately the same semantics as the reference answer or at least refer to the same entity. The reference answer is a time range (business hours), while the response states ""closed,"" which implies no operating hours.

Since ""closed"" conveys a meaning opposite or completely different from the time range ""8am-4:30pm,"" the semantics are not approximately the same.

Final score for idx_0: 0
