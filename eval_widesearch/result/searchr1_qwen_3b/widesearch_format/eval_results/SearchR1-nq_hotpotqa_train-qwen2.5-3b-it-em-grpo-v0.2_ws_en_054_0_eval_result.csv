### idx_0
- Response: 2024
- Target: 2021
- Difference: 3 years
- Since the difference exceeds 1 year, this does not meet the criterion.

Score: 0

### idx_1
- Response: 2020
- Target: 2014
- Difference: 6 years
- Exceeds 1 year gap, so no score.

Criterion:  
- It is sufficient if the semantics are approximately the same as the reference answer or if they point to the same entity.  
- No need for word-for-word correspondence.

Analysis:

1. idx_0:  
   - Response: ""pennsylvania""  
   - Target: ""pennsylvania""  
   - Same entity, exact match.  
   - Score = 1

2. idx_1:

   - Target: ""utah""  
   - Same entity, exact match.  
   - Score = 1

All responses point exactly to the same entity as the target, so all get full credit.
