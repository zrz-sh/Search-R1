- **Response:** `""notmentioned""`

- **Analysis:**
  - The response is `""notmentioned""`, which presumably means the answer is ""not mentioned"".
  - The standard answer lists three course names with credit values.
  - The criterion states that it is sufficient if semantics approximately match or point to the same entity.
  - Here, the response does not mention any part of the standard answer or anything close to it.
  - There is no partial credit mentioned or required; the score must be 0 or 1.
  - Since the response does not mention or approximate the target answer, score = 0.

  ```
- **Response:** `""media,cultureandsociety,digitalmediapractices""`

- **Analysis:**
  - The target references ""introductiontomediaandcommunicationstheory"" (30 credits) and ""dissertation"" (60 credits).
  - The response lists ""media"", ""cultureandsociety"" and ""digitalmediapractices"" – presumably course names.
  - The course names in the response do not match or closely approximate those in the standard answer.
  - The criterion states approximate semantic or entity match is sufficient, but ""media, culture and society, digital media practices"" do not match ""introduction to media and communications theory"" or ""dissertation"".
  - Dissertation is a major item, and it is missing.
  - Thus, no semantic or entity match.
  - Therefore, score = 0.

**Grading criteria summary:**  
- Score 1 if the response's semantics are approximately the same as the target answer or point to the same entity.  
- No word-for-word matching required.  
- Acceptable if the model outputs the calculated score (e.g., ""60"" for ""30 + 30"").

### Analysis:

- Target: ""30+30+60""  
- Response: ""/""  
- The response is just ""/"", which does not relate semantically to the target. It is not the same entity or approximate semantics.

**idx_0**  
- Target: ""6.5 with a 6.5 in writing and no element lower than 6.0""  
- Response: ""overall7.0, reading7.0, writing7.0""  

Analysis:  
- The response states all components are scored 7.0, which is higher than the target's minimums.  
- The target requires at least 6.5 overall and writing 6.5, with no element below 6.0. The response exceeds this requirement clearly.  
- The semantics match or exceed the target; although not word-for-word, the meaning is consistent or better.  
- Therefore, it satisfies the criterion of approximate semantics and same entity.

- Target: ""6.5 with a 6.5 in writing and no element lower than 6.0""

1. **idx_0**:  
   - Response: ""notmentioned""  
   - Target: ""1yearfull-time""  
   - Analysis:  
     The response indicates that the period (presumably duration) is not mentioned, while the target specifies ""1 year full-time"". These are clearly not semantically equivalent nor pointing to the same entity. Thus, score = 0.

2. **idx_1**:  
   - Response: ""3years""  
   - Target: ""1yearfull-time""  
   - Analysis:  
     The response gives ""3 years"" whereas the target is ""1 year full-time"". These differ in length, so they do not point to the same entity nor are semantically approximately the same. No deduction rules given for partial credit; it is either 0 or 1. So score = 0.
