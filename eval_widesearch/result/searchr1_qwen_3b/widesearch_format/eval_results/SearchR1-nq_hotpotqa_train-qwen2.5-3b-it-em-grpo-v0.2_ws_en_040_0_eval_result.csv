- It is sufficient if the semantics are approximately the same as the reference answer or if they point to the same entity.

Given that both the response and target are a single word naming a country, the match depends on whether the response matches the target or not.

Criterion:
- It is sufficient if the semantics are approximately the same as the reference answer or if they point to the same entity.
- No need for exact word-for-word matching, as long as the entity is the same.

Given that both the response and target are a single word naming a country, the match depends on whether the response matches the target or not.

Criterion:
- It is sufficient if the semantics are approximately the same as the reference answer or if they point to the same entity.
- No need for exact word-for-word matching, as long as the entity is the same.

Given that both the response and target are a single word naming a country, the match depends on whether the response matches the target or not.
