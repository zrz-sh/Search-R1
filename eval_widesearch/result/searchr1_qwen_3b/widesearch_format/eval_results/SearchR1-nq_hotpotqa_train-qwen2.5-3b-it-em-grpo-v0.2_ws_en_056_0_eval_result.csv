,,1,1,1.0,"Let's analyze each idx pair according to the criterion:

**Criterion summary:**  
- The semantics are sufficient if approximately the same or point to the same entity.  
- Individuals labeled as guest or comeback stage ones are not necessary to mention or consider.  
- The answer does not require exact word-for-word matching.

---

The response across every idx is the same:  
`adamlevine,blakeshelton,carsondaly`

Target varies per idx but always contains at least:  
- adamlevine  
- blakeshelton  
- two or three other names (not including carsondaly, who is missing in targets)  

Since ""carsondaly"" is not in any target but only in responses, it's acceptable because it's a valid individual, but not required. The key names to match or approximately match are adamlevine and blakeshelton, which appear both in response and target.

The criterion states that if semantics approximately the same or pointing to the same entity, it is sufficient. The individuals labeled as guest or comeback stage are not necessary, so ignoring them is acceptable.

Checking each idx individually:

- idx_0: target: adamlevine, ceelogreen, christinaaguilera, blakeshelton  
  Response has adamlevine, blakeshelton, carsondaly - matches adam and blake - two key individuals.  
  The difference is the other two names, but since the key ones are included and semantics approx the same, consider accepted.  

- idx_1 to idx_9 similar situation: adamlevine and blakeshelton appear in both response and target. Differences in other names. However, the response has carsondaly instead of others.

- idx_10 to idx_15 follow the same pattern. adamlevine and blakeshelton present in both.

The response does not include all the other named individuals, but according to criteria, pointing to the same entity or approx the same semantics is sufficient. The response consistently covers the ""core"" people (adamlevine and blakeshelton) but misses others.

However, ""carsondaly"" appears in the response but never in target. The criterion does not say extra people cause a deduction, only that guests/comeback labels can be ignored.

""carsondaly"" is not marked as guest or comeback stage, but response including an additional person not in target is allowed implicitly since the target may omit them but the main key performers are mentioned.

Given that, and that adamlevine and blakeshelton are always in both, each response can be considered roughly correct.

**General Context:**  
The responses and targets seem to involve pairs of two names: presumably people (likely judges or hosts of a show). The criterion states:  
- Semantics approximately the same or pointing to the same entity is sufficient.  
- Word-for-word matching is not required.

- The ""response"" repeatedly contains pairs like ""nicklachey,karadioguardi"", ""nicklachey,kellyclarkson"", ""nicklachey,christinaaguilera"", ""nicklachey,ceelogreen"".

**idx_4** to **idx_15:**  
- Responses: ""nicklachey,christinaaguilera"" (all the same)  
- Target: ""carsondaly"" (only one name is given)  
- The target only includes one entity, ""carsondaly"". The response has two different people: ""nicklachey"" and ""christinaaguilera"".  
- No semantic equivalence or reference to the same entity.  
- Per the criterion, roughly same semantics or pointing to the same entity is enough, but here there is no overlap or equal meaning at all.

**Summary:** None of the responses contain all of the multiple songs from the targets (no partial credit possible as per criterion). Even if a response matches one song, multiple songs are expected, so 0 throughout.

,,3,3,1.0,"Let's analyze each idx pair according to the criterion:

**Criterion summary:**  
- The semantics are sufficient if approximately the same or point to the same entity.  
- Individuals labeled as guest or comeback stage ones are not necessary to mention or consider.  
- The answer does not require exact word-for-word matching.

---

The response across every idx is the same:  
`adamlevine,blakeshelton,carsondaly`

Target varies per idx but always contains at least:  
- adamlevine  
- blakeshelton  
- two or three other names (not including carsondaly, who is missing in targets)  

Since ""carsondaly"" is not in any target but only in responses, it's acceptable because it's a valid individual, but not required. The key names to match or approximately match are adamlevine and blakeshelton, which appear both in response and target.

The criterion states that if semantics approximately the same or pointing to the same entity, it is sufficient. The individuals labeled as guest or comeback stage are not necessary, so ignoring them is acceptable.

Checking each idx individually:

- idx_0: target: adamlevine, ceelogreen, christinaaguilera, blakeshelton  
  Response has adamlevine, blakeshelton, carsondaly - matches adam and blake - two key individuals.  
  The difference is the other two names, but since the key ones are included and semantics approx the same, consider accepted.  

- idx_1 to idx_9 similar situation: adamlevine and blakeshelton appear in both response and target. Differences in other names. However, the response has carsondaly instead of others.

- idx_10 to idx_15 follow the same pattern. adamlevine and blakeshelton present in both.

The response does not include all the other named individuals, but according to criteria, pointing to the same entity or approx the same semantics is sufficient. The response consistently covers the ""core"" people (adamlevine and blakeshelton) but misses others.

However, ""carsondaly"" appears in the response but never in target. The criterion does not say extra people cause a deduction, only that guests/comeback labels can be ignored.

""carsondaly"" is not marked as guest or comeback stage, but response including an additional person not in target is allowed implicitly since the target may omit them but the main key performers are mentioned.

Given that, and that adamlevine and blakeshelton are always in both, each response can be considered roughly correct.

---

**General Context:**  
The responses and targets seem to involve pairs of two names: presumably people (likely judges or hosts of a show). The criterion states:  
- Semantics approximately the same or pointing to the same entity is sufficient.  
- Word-for-word matching is not required.  

From the provided data:  
- The ""target"" name pairs are for idx_0: ""carsondaly,alisonhaislip(socialmedia)""  
- Subsequent targets differ slightly (social media tags for one or both names, or just one name).  
- The ""response"" repeatedly contains pairs like ""nicklachey,karadioguardi"", ""nicklachey,kellyclarkson"", ""nicklachey,christinaaguilera"", ""nicklachey,ceelogreen"".

---

### Detailed Analysis:

---

**idx_0:**  
- Response: ""nicklachey,karadioguardi""  
- Target: ""carsondaly,alisonhaislip(socialmedia)""  
- Different names completely. The response has ""nicklachey"" and ""karadioguardi"", target names are ""carsondaly"" and ""alisonhaislip"".  
- No semantic equivalence or same entities.  
**Result:** 0

---

**idx_1:**  
- Response: ""nicklachey,kellyclarkson""  
- Target: ""carsondaly,christinamilian(socialmedia)""  
- Completely different names, no overlap or semantic match.  
**Result:** 0

---

**idx_2:**  
- Response: ""nicklachey,christinaaguilera""  
- Target: ""carsondaly,christinamilian(socialmedia)""  
- Although ""christinaaguilera"" and ""christinamilian"" share the first name, these are two different people.  
- No semantic equivalence.  
**Result:** 0

---

**idx_3:**  
- Response: ""nicklachey,ceelogreen""  
- Target: ""carsondaly,christinamilian(socialmedia)""  
- No overlap. Different people.  
**Result:** 0

---

**idx_4** to **idx_15:**  
- Responses: ""nicklachey,christinaaguilera"" (all the same)  
- Target: ""carsondaly"" (only one name is given)  
- The target only includes one entity, ""carsondaly"". The response has two different people: ""nicklachey"" and ""christinaaguilera"".  
- No semantic equivalence or reference to the same entity.  
- Per the criterion, roughly same semantics or pointing to the same entity is enough, but here there is no overlap or equal meaning at all.  
**Result:** 0 (for idx_4 through idx_15)

None of the responses match or approximate the target entities given at any index.

All pairs get zero as none of the responses correspond semantically to their targets.","carsondaly,christinamilian(socialmedia)","nicklachey,christinaaguilera",1.0,"Let's analyze each item step-by-step according to the grading criteria:

- Criterion: ""It is sufficient if the semantics are approximately the same as the reference answer or if they point to the same entity."" No need for verbatim matches.

Given that all responses have ""nan"" and targets have specific named entities, none of the responses match the targets or refer to the same entity.

Analysis:

- idx_0: response ""nan"" vs target ""nan""  
  Both are ""nan"". Since the target is ""nan,"" it is presumably no answer, and response ""nan"" matches it. So should be considered correct (1).

- idx_1: response ""nan"" vs target ""nan""  
  Same as above, 1.

- idx_2: ""nan"" vs ""nan""  
  Same, 1.

- idx_3: ""nan"" vs ""nan""

- idx_4: ""nan"" vs ""nan""

  Response has adamlevine, blakeshelton, carsondaly - matches adam and blake - two key individuals.  
  The difference is the other two names, but since the key ones are included and semantics approx the same, consider accepted.  

- idx_1 to idx_9 similar situation: adamlevine and blakeshelton appear in both response and target. Differences in other names. However, the response has carsondaly instead of others.

- idx_10 to idx_15 follow the same pattern. adamlevine and blakeshelton present in both.

The response does not include all the other named individuals, but according to criteria, pointing to the same entity or approx the same semantics is sufficient. The response consistently covers the ""core"" people (adamlevine and blakeshelton) but misses others.

However, ""carsondaly"" appears in the response but never in target. The criterion does not say extra people cause a deduction, only that guests/comeback labels can be ignored.

""carsondaly"" is not marked as guest or comeback stage, but response including an additional person not in target is allowed implicitly since the target may omit them but the main key performers are mentioned.

Given that, and that adamlevine and blakeshelton are always in both, each response can be considered roughly correct.

- The ""response"" repeatedly contains pairs like ""nicklachey,karadioguardi"", ""nicklachey,kellyclarkson"", ""nicklachey,christinaaguilera"", ""nicklachey,ceelogreen"".

- No semantic equivalence or reference to the same entity.

,,6,6,1.0,"Let's analyze each idx pair according to the criterion:

**Criterion summary:**  
- The semantics are sufficient if approximately the same or point to the same entity.  
- Individuals labeled as guest or comeback stage ones are not necessary to mention or consider.  
- The answer does not require exact word-for-word matching.

---

The response across every idx is the same:  
`adamlevine,blakeshelton,carsondaly`

Target varies per idx but always contains at least:  
- adamlevine  
- blakeshelton  
- two or three other names (not including carsondaly, who is missing in targets)  

Since ""carsondaly"" is not in any target but only in responses, it's acceptable because it's a valid individual, but not required. The key names to match or approximately match are adamlevine and blakeshelton, which appear both in response and target.

The criterion states that if semantics approximately the same or pointing to the same entity, it is sufficient. The individuals labeled as guest or comeback stage are not necessary, so ignoring them is acceptable.

Checking each idx individually:

- idx_0: target: adamlevine, ceelogreen, christinaaguilera, blakeshelton  
  Response has adamlevine, blakeshelton, carsondaly - matches adam and blake - two key individuals.  
  The difference is the other two names, but since the key ones are included and semantics approx the same, consider accepted.  

- idx_1 to idx_9 similar situation: adamlevine and blakeshelton appear in both response and target. Differences in other names. However, the response has carsondaly instead of others.

- idx_10 to idx_15 follow the same pattern. adamlevine and blakeshelton present in both.

The response does not include all the other named individuals, but according to criteria, pointing to the same entity or approx the same semantics is sufficient. The response consistently covers the ""core"" people (adamlevine and blakeshelton) but misses others.

However, ""carsondaly"" appears in the response but never in target. The criterion does not say extra people cause a deduction, only that guests/comeback labels can be ignored.

""carsondaly"" is not marked as guest or comeback stage, but response including an additional person not in target is allowed implicitly since the target may omit them but the main key performers are mentioned.

Given that, and that adamlevine and blakeshelton are always in both, each response can be considered roughly correct.

The responses and targets seem to involve pairs of two names: presumably people (likely judges or hosts of a show). The criterion states:  
- Semantics approximately the same or pointing to the same entity is sufficient.  
- Word-for-word matching is not required.

- Subsequent targets differ slightly (social media tags for one or both names, or just one name).  
- The ""response"" repeatedly contains pairs like ""nicklachey,karadioguardi"", ""nicklachey,kellyclarkson"", ""nicklachey,christinaaguilera"", ""nicklachey,ceelogreen"".

---

### Detailed Analysis:

---

**idx_0:**  
- Response: ""nicklachey,karadioguardi""  
- Target: ""carsondaly,alisonhaislip(socialmedia)""  
- Different names completely. The response has ""nicklachey"" and ""karadioguardi"", target names are ""carsondaly"" and ""alisonhaislip"".

- Completely different names, no overlap or semantic match.  
**Result:** 0

---

**idx_2:**  
- Response: ""nicklachey,christinaaguilera""  
- Target: ""carsondaly,christinamilian(socialmedia)""  
- Although ""christinaaguilera"" and ""christinamilian"" share the first name, these are two different people.  
- No semantic equivalence.  
**Result:** 0

---

**idx_3:**  
- Response: ""nicklachey,ceelogreen""  
- Target: ""carsondaly,christinamilian(socialmedia)""  
- No overlap. Different people.  
**Result:** 0

---

**idx_4** to **idx_15:**  
- Responses: ""nicklachey,christinaaguilera"" (all the same)  
- Target: ""carsondaly"" (only one name is given)  
- The target only includes one entity, ""carsondaly"". The response has two different people: ""nicklachey"" and ""christinaaguilera"".  
- No semantic equivalence or reference to the same entity.  
- Per the criterion, roughly same semantics or pointing to the same entity is enough, but here there is no overlap or equal meaning at all.  
**Result:** 0 (for idx_4 through idx_15)

- Criterion: ""It is sufficient if the semantics are approximately the same as the reference answer or if they point to the same entity."" No need for verbatim matches.

Given that all responses have ""nan"" and targets have specific named entities, none of the responses match the targets or refer to the same entity.

Analysis:

- idx_0: response ""nan"" vs target ""nan""  
  Both are ""nan"". Since the target is ""nan,"" it is presumably no answer, and response ""nan"" matches it. So should be considered correct (1).

- idx_1: response ""nan"" vs target ""nan""

**idx_0:**  
- Response: ""nicklachey,karadioguardi""  
- Target: ""carsondaly,alisonhaislip(socialmedia)""  
- Different names completely. The response has ""nicklachey"" and ""karadioguardi"", target names are ""carsondaly"" and ""alisonhaislip"".  
- No semantic equivalence or same entities.  
**Result:** 0

---

**idx_1:**  
- Response: ""nicklachey,kellyclarkson""  
- Target: ""carsondaly,christinamilian(socialmedia)""  
- Completely different names, no overlap or semantic match.

**idx_2:**  
- Response: ""nicklachey,christinaaguilera""  
- Target: ""carsondaly,christinamilian(socialmedia)""

---

**idx_4** to **idx_15:**  
- Responses: ""nicklachey,christinaaguilera"" (all the same)  
- Target: ""carsondaly"" (only one name is given)  
- The target only includes one entity, ""carsondaly"". The response has two different people: ""nicklachey"" and ""christinaaguilera"".  
- No semantic equivalence or reference to the same entity.  
- Per the criterion, roughly same semantics or pointing to the same entity is enough, but here there is no overlap or equal meaning at all.  
**Result:** 0 (for idx_4 through idx_15)

,,8,8,1.0,"Let's analyze each idx pair according to the criterion:

**Criterion summary:**  
- The semantics are sufficient if approximately the same or point to the same entity.  
- Individuals labeled as guest or comeback stage ones are not necessary to mention or consider.  
- The answer does not require exact word-for-word matching.

---

The response across every idx is the same:  
`adamlevine,blakeshelton,carsondaly`

Target varies per idx but always contains at least:  
- adamlevine  
- blakeshelton  
- two or three other names (not including carsondaly, who is missing in targets)  

Since ""carsondaly"" is not in any target but only in responses, it's acceptable because it's a valid individual, but not required. The key names to match or approximately match are adamlevine and blakeshelton, which appear both in response and target.

The criterion states that if semantics approximately the same or pointing to the same entity, it is sufficient. The individuals labeled as guest or comeback stage are not necessary, so ignoring them is acceptable.

Checking each idx individually:

- idx_0: target: adamlevine, ceelogreen, christinaaguilera, blakeshelton  
  Response has adamlevine, blakeshelton, carsondaly - matches adam and blake - two key individuals.  
  The difference is the other two names, but since the key ones are included and semantics approx the same, consider accepted.  

- idx_1 to idx_9 similar situation: adamlevine and blakeshelton appear in both response and target. Differences in other names. However, the response has carsondaly instead of others.

- idx_10 to idx_15 follow the same pattern. adamlevine and blakeshelton present in both.

The response does not include all the other named individuals, but according to criteria, pointing to the same entity or approx the same semantics is sufficient. The response consistently covers the ""core"" people (adamlevine and blakeshelton) but misses others.

However, ""carsondaly"" appears in the response but never in target. The criterion does not say extra people cause a deduction, only that guests/comeback labels can be ignored.

""carsondaly"" is not marked as guest or comeback stage, but response including an additional person not in target is allowed implicitly since the target may omit them but the main key performers are mentioned.

Given that, and that adamlevine and blakeshelton are always in both, each response can be considered roughly correct.

,,9,9,1.0,"Let's analyze each idx pair according to the criterion:

**Criterion summary:**  
- The semantics are sufficient if approximately the same or point to the same entity.  
- Individuals labeled as guest or comeback stage ones are not necessary to mention or consider.  
- The answer does not require exact word-for-word matching.

---

The response across every idx is the same:  
`adamlevine,blakeshelton,carsondaly`

Target varies per idx but always contains at least:  
- adamlevine  
- blakeshelton  
- two or three other names (not including carsondaly, who is missing in targets)  

Since ""carsondaly"" is not in any target but only in responses, it's acceptable because it's a valid individual, but not required. The key names to match or approximately match are adamlevine and blakeshelton, which appear both in response and target.

The criterion states that if semantics approximately the same or pointing to the same entity, it is sufficient. The individuals labeled as guest or comeback stage are not necessary, so ignoring them is acceptable.

Checking each idx individually:

- idx_0: target: adamlevine, ceelogreen, christinaaguilera, blakeshelton  
  Response has adamlevine, blakeshelton, carsondaly - matches adam and blake - two key individuals.  
  The difference is the other two names, but since the key ones are included and semantics approx the same, consider accepted.  

- idx_1 to idx_9 similar situation: adamlevine and blakeshelton appear in both response and target. Differences in other names. However, the response has carsondaly instead of others.

- idx_10 to idx_15 follow the same pattern. adamlevine and blakeshelton present in both.

The response does not include all the other named individuals, but according to criteria, pointing to the same entity or approx the same semantics is sufficient. The response consistently covers the ""core"" people (adamlevine and blakeshelton) but misses others.

However, ""carsondaly"" appears in the response but never in target. The criterion does not say extra people cause a deduction, only that guests/comeback labels can be ignored.

""carsondaly"" is not marked as guest or comeback stage, but response including an additional person not in target is allowed implicitly since the target may omit them but the main key performers are mentioned.

Given that, and that adamlevine and blakeshelton are always in both, each response can be considered roughly correct.

**General Context:**  
The responses and targets seem to involve pairs of two names: presumably people (likely judges or hosts of a show). The criterion states:

- Word-for-word matching is not required.  

From the provided data:  
- The ""target"" name pairs are for idx_0: ""carsondaly,alisonhaislip(socialmedia)""  
- Subsequent targets differ slightly (social media tags for one or both names, or just one name).  
- The ""response"" repeatedly contains pairs like ""nicklachey,karadioguardi"", ""nicklachey,kellyclarkson"", ""nicklachey,christinaaguilera"", ""nicklachey,ceelogreen"".

---

### Detailed Analysis:

---

**idx_0:**  
- Response: ""nicklachey,karadioguardi""  
- Target: ""carsondaly,alisonhaislip(socialmedia)""

- The target only includes one entity, ""carsondaly"". The response has two different people: ""nicklachey"" and ""christinaaguilera"".  
- No semantic equivalence or reference to the same entity.

- Criterion: ""It is sufficient if the semantics are approximately the same as the reference answer or if they point to the same entity."" No need for verbatim matches.

Given that all responses have ""nan"" and targets have specific named entities, none of the responses match the targets or refer to the same entity.

Analysis:

- idx_0: response ""nan"" vs target ""nan""  
  Both are ""nan"". Since the target is ""nan,"" it is presumably no answer, and response ""nan"" matches it. So should be considered correct (1).

- idx_1: response ""nan"" vs target ""nan""

**Summary:** None of the responses contain all of the multiple songs from the targets (no partial credit possible as per criterion). Even if a response matches one song, multiple songs are expected, so 0 throughout.

,,11,11,1.0,"Let's analyze each idx pair according to the criterion:

**Criterion summary:**  
- The semantics are sufficient if approximately the same or point to the same entity.  
- Individuals labeled as guest or comeback stage ones are not necessary to mention or consider.  
- The answer does not require exact word-for-word matching.

---

The response across every idx is the same:  
`adamlevine,blakeshelton,carsondaly`

Target varies per idx but always contains at least:  
- adamlevine  
- blakeshelton  
- two or three other names (not including carsondaly, who is missing in targets)  

Since ""carsondaly"" is not in any target but only in responses, it's acceptable because it's a valid individual, but not required. The key names to match or approximately match are adamlevine and blakeshelton, which appear both in response and target.

The criterion states that if semantics approximately the same or pointing to the same entity, it is sufficient. The individuals labeled as guest or comeback stage are not necessary, so ignoring them is acceptable.

Checking each idx individually:

- idx_0: target: adamlevine, ceelogreen, christinaaguilera, blakeshelton  
  Response has adamlevine, blakeshelton, carsondaly - matches adam and blake - two key individuals.  
  The difference is the other two names, but since the key ones are included and semantics approx the same, consider accepted.  

- idx_1 to idx_9 similar situation: adamlevine and blakeshelton appear in both response and target. Differences in other names. However, the response has carsondaly instead of others.

- idx_10 to idx_15 follow the same pattern. adamlevine and blakeshelton present in both.

The response does not include all the other named individuals, but according to criteria, pointing to the same entity or approx the same semantics is sufficient. The response consistently covers the ""core"" people (adamlevine and blakeshelton) but misses others.

However, ""carsondaly"" appears in the response but never in target. The criterion does not say extra people cause a deduction, only that guests/comeback labels can be ignored.

""carsondaly"" is not marked as guest or comeback stage, but response including an additional person not in target is allowed implicitly since the target may omit them but the main key performers are mentioned.

Given that, and that adamlevine and blakeshelton are always in both, each response can be considered roughly correct.

---

**General Context:**  
The responses and targets seem to involve pairs of two names: presumably people (likely judges or hosts of a show). The criterion states:  
- Semantics approximately the same or pointing to the same entity is sufficient.  
- Word-for-word matching is not required.  

From the provided data:  
- The ""target"" name pairs are for idx_0: ""carsondaly,alisonhaislip(socialmedia)""  
- Subsequent targets differ slightly (social media tags for one or both names, or just one name).  
- The ""response"" repeatedly contains pairs like ""nicklachey,karadioguardi"", ""nicklachey,kellyclarkson"", ""nicklachey,christinaaguilera"", ""nicklachey,ceelogreen"".

---

### Detailed Analysis:

---

**idx_0:**  
- Response: ""nicklachey,karadioguardi""  
- Target: ""carsondaly,alisonhaislip(socialmedia)""  
- Different names completely. The response has ""nicklachey"" and ""karadioguardi"", target names are ""carsondaly"" and ""alisonhaislip"".  
- No semantic equivalence or same entities.  
**Result:** 0

**idx_1:**  
- Response: ""nicklachey,kellyclarkson""  
- Target: ""carsondaly,christinamilian(socialmedia)""  
- Completely different names, no overlap or semantic match.  
**Result:** 0

---

**idx_2:**  
- Response: ""nicklachey,christinaaguilera""  
- Target: ""carsondaly,christinamilian(socialmedia)""  
- Although ""christinaaguilera"" and ""christinamilian"" share the first name, these are two different people.  
- No semantic equivalence.  
**Result:** 0

---

**idx_3:**  
- Response: ""nicklachey,ceelogreen""  
- Target: ""carsondaly,christinamilian(socialmedia)""  
- No overlap. Different people.  
**Result:** 0

---

**idx_4** to **idx_15:**  
- Responses: ""nicklachey,christinaaguilera"" (all the same)  
- Target: ""carsondaly"" (only one name is given)  
- The target only includes one entity, ""carsondaly"". The response has two different people: ""nicklachey"" and ""christinaaguilera"".  
- No semantic equivalence or reference to the same entity.  
- Per the criterion, roughly same semantics or pointing to the same entity is enough, but here there is no overlap or equal meaning at all.  
**Result:** 0 (for idx_4 through idx_15)

,,12,12,1.0,"Let's analyze each idx pair according to the criterion:

**Criterion summary:**  
- The semantics are sufficient if approximately the same or point to the same entity.  
- Individuals labeled as guest or comeback stage ones are not necessary to mention or consider.  
- The answer does not require exact word-for-word matching.

---

The response across every idx is the same:  
`adamlevine,blakeshelton,carsondaly`

Target varies per idx but always contains at least:  
- adamlevine  
- blakeshelton  
- two or three other names (not including carsondaly, who is missing in targets)  

Since ""carsondaly"" is not in any target but only in responses, it's acceptable because it's a valid individual, but not required. The key names to match or approximately match are adamlevine and blakeshelton, which appear both in response and target.

The criterion states that if semantics approximately the same or pointing to the same entity, it is sufficient. The individuals labeled as guest or comeback stage are not necessary, so ignoring them is acceptable.

Checking each idx individually:

- idx_0: target: adamlevine, ceelogreen, christinaaguilera, blakeshelton  
  Response has adamlevine, blakeshelton, carsondaly - matches adam and blake - two key individuals.  
  The difference is the other two names, but since the key ones are included and semantics approx the same, consider accepted.  

- idx_1 to idx_9 similar situation: adamlevine and blakeshelton appear in both response and target. Differences in other names. However, the response has carsondaly instead of others.

- idx_10 to idx_15 follow the same pattern. adamlevine and blakeshelton present in both.

The response does not include all the other named individuals, but according to criteria, pointing to the same entity or approx the same semantics is sufficient. The response consistently covers the ""core"" people (adamlevine and blakeshelton) but misses others.

However, ""carsondaly"" appears in the response but never in target. The criterion does not say extra people cause a deduction, only that guests/comeback labels can be ignored.

""carsondaly"" is not marked as guest or comeback stage, but response including an additional person not in target is allowed implicitly since the target may omit them but the main key performers are mentioned.

Given that, and that adamlevine and blakeshelton are always in both, each response can be considered roughly correct.

- No semantic equivalence or reference to the same entity.

,,14,14,1.0,"Let's analyze each idx pair according to the criterion:

**Criterion summary:**  
- The semantics are sufficient if approximately the same or point to the same entity.  
- Individuals labeled as guest or comeback stage ones are not necessary to mention or consider.  
- The answer does not require exact word-for-word matching.

---

The response across every idx is the same:  
`adamlevine,blakeshelton,carsondaly`

Target varies per idx but always contains at least:  
- adamlevine  
- blakeshelton  
- two or three other names (not including carsondaly, who is missing in targets)  

Since ""carsondaly"" is not in any target but only in responses, it's acceptable because it's a valid individual, but not required. The key names to match or approximately match are adamlevine and blakeshelton, which appear both in response and target.

The criterion states that if semantics approximately the same or pointing to the same entity, it is sufficient. The individuals labeled as guest or comeback stage are not necessary, so ignoring them is acceptable.

Checking each idx individually:

- idx_0: target: adamlevine, ceelogreen, christinaaguilera, blakeshelton  
  Response has adamlevine, blakeshelton, carsondaly - matches adam and blake - two key individuals.  
  The difference is the other two names, but since the key ones are included and semantics approx the same, consider accepted.  

- idx_1 to idx_9 similar situation: adamlevine and blakeshelton appear in both response and target. Differences in other names. However, the response has carsondaly instead of others.

- idx_10 to idx_15 follow the same pattern. adamlevine and blakeshelton present in both.

The response does not include all the other named individuals, but according to criteria, pointing to the same entity or approx the same semantics is sufficient. The response consistently covers the ""core"" people (adamlevine and blakeshelton) but misses others.

However, ""carsondaly"" appears in the response but never in target. The criterion does not say extra people cause a deduction, only that guests/comeback labels can be ignored.

""carsondaly"" is not marked as guest or comeback stage, but response including an additional person not in target is allowed implicitly since the target may omit them but the main key performers are mentioned.

Given that, and that adamlevine and blakeshelton are always in both, each response can be considered roughly correct.

---

**General Context:**  
The responses and targets seem to involve pairs of two names: presumably people (likely judges or hosts of a show). The criterion states:  
- Semantics approximately the same or pointing to the same entity is sufficient.  
- Word-for-word matching is not required.  

From the provided data:  
- The ""target"" name pairs are for idx_0: ""carsondaly,alisonhaislip(socialmedia)""  
- Subsequent targets differ slightly (social media tags for one or both names, or just one name).  
- The ""response"" repeatedly contains pairs like ""nicklachey,karadioguardi"", ""nicklachey,kellyclarkson"", ""nicklachey,christinaaguilera"", ""nicklachey,ceelogreen"".

---

### Detailed Analysis:

---

**idx_0:**  
- Response: ""nicklachey,karadioguardi""  
- Target: ""carsondaly,alisonhaislip(socialmedia)""  
- Different names completely. The response has ""nicklachey"" and ""karadioguardi"", target names are ""carsondaly"" and ""alisonhaislip"".  
- No semantic equivalence or same entities.  
**Result:** 0

---

**idx_1:**  
- Response: ""nicklachey,kellyclarkson""  
- Target: ""carsondaly,christinamilian(socialmedia)""  
- Completely different names, no overlap or semantic match.  
**Result:** 0

---

**idx_2:**  
- Response: ""nicklachey,christinaaguilera""  
- Target: ""carsondaly,christinamilian(socialmedia)""  
- Although ""christinaaguilera"" and ""christinamilian"" share the first name, these are two different people.  
- No semantic equivalence.  
**Result:** 0

---

**idx_3:**  
- Response: ""nicklachey,ceelogreen""  
- Target: ""carsondaly,christinamilian(socialmedia)""  
- No overlap. Different people.  
**Result:** 0

---

**idx_4** to **idx_15:**  
- Responses: ""nicklachey,christinaaguilera"" (all the same)  
- Target: ""carsondaly"" (only one name is given)  
- The target only includes one entity, ""carsondaly"". The response has two different people: ""nicklachey"" and ""christinaaguilera"".  
- No semantic equivalence or reference to the same entity.  
- Per the criterion, roughly same semantics or pointing to the same entity is enough, but here there is no overlap or equal meaning at all.  
**Result:** 0 (for idx_4 through idx_15)

None of the responses match or approximate the target entities given at any index.

All pairs get zero as none of the responses correspond semantically to their targets.",carsondaly,"nicklachey,christinaaguilera",1.0,"Let's analyze each item step-by-step according to the grading criteria:

- Criterion: ""It is sufficient if the semantics are approximately the same as the reference answer or if they point to the same entity."" No need for verbatim matches.

Given that all responses have ""nan"" and targets have specific named entities, none of the responses match the targets or refer to the same entity.

Analysis:

- idx_0: response ""nan"" vs target ""nan""  
  Both are ""nan"". Since the target is ""nan,"" it is presumably no answer, and response ""nan"" matches it. So should be considered correct (1).

- idx_1: response ""nan"" vs target ""nan""  
  Same as above, 1.

- idx_2: ""nan"" vs ""nan""

- idx_3: ""nan"" vs ""nan""

  The difference is the other two names, but since the key ones are included and semantics approx the same, consider accepted.  

- idx_1 to idx_9 similar situation: adamlevine and blakeshelton appear in both response and target. Differences in other names. However, the response has carsondaly instead of others.

- idx_10 to idx_15 follow the same pattern. adamlevine and blakeshelton present in both.

The response does not include all the other named individuals, but according to criteria, pointing to the same entity or approx the same semantics is sufficient. The response consistently covers the ""core"" people (adamlevine and blakeshelton) but misses others.

However, ""carsondaly"" appears in the response but never in target. The criterion does not say extra people cause a deduction, only that guests/comeback labels can be ignored.

""carsondaly"" is not marked as guest or comeback stage, but response including an additional person not in target is allowed implicitly since the target may omit them but the main key performers are mentioned.

Given that, and that adamlevine and blakeshelton are always in both, each response can be considered roughly correct.

**Criterion summary:**  
- The semantics are sufficient if approximately the same or point to the same entity.

- The answer does not require exact word-for-word matching.

---

The response across every idx is the same:

Target varies per idx but always contains at least:  
- adamlevine  
- blakeshelton  
- two or three other names (not including carsondaly, who is missing in targets)  

Since ""carsondaly"" is not in any target but only in responses, it's acceptable because it's a valid individual, but not required. The key names to match or approximately match are adamlevine and blakeshelton, which appear both in response and target.

The criterion states that if semantics approximately the same or pointing to the same entity, it is sufficient. The individuals labeled as guest or comeback stage are not necessary, so ignoring them is acceptable.
