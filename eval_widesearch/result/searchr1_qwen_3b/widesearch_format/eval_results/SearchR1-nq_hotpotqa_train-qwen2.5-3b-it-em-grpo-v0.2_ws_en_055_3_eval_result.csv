Criterion: It is sufficient if the semantics are approximately the same as the reference answer or if they point to the same entity. No need for exact word-for-word match.

**idx_0**  
- Response: ""thewaltdisneycompany""  
- Target: ""thewaltdisneycompany""  
Analysis: Exact match, so clearly 1.

**idx_1**  
- Response: ""thewaltdisneycompany""  
- Target: ""thewaltdisneycompany""  
Analysis: Exact match again, clearly 1.

**idx_2**  
- Response: ""amblinentertainment,comcast,nbcuniversal""  
- Target: ""universaldestinations&experiences""  
Analysis:  
- The entities mentioned are ""amblin entertainment"", ""comcast"", ""nbc universal"", which are separate companies/entities.  
- The target is ""universal destinations & experiences,"" which is a part of NBCUniversal (though NBCUniversal is part of Comcast).  
- The response mentions different entities related to entertainment but does not point to the same entity as the reference, nor are the semantics approximately the same (Universal Destinations & Experiences is a specific division of NBCUniversal focused on theme parks).  
- Given the criterion that the semantics must be approximately the same or point to the same entity, this does not qualify. It is a mismatch.

Therefore, idx_2 should get 0.
