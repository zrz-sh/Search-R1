""It is sufficient if the semantics are approximately the same as the reference answer or if they point to the same entity.""

---

### idx_0  
- Response: 'highland'  
- Target: 'highland,argyllandbute,\nperthandkinross'  
- Analysis: The response contains only one of the three entities listed in the target. Since the response points to the same entity ""highland"" which is part of the target, and the criterion states that it's sufficient if the semantics are the same or point to the same entity, this is acceptable. The fact that other target entities are missing might be acceptable if the response still matches some entities.  
- Conclusion: Since it covers at least one correct entity, and partial coverage is accepted per criterion, score = 1.

---

### idx_1  
- Response: 'highland'  
- Target: 'highland,argyllandbute,\nperthandkinross'

### idx_2  
- Response: 'aberdeenshire,moray,highland'  
- Target: 'highland,aberdeenshire,\nmoray'  
- Analysis: Response exactly includes all target entities, just the order differs. The criterion allows for approximate semantics and order is irrelevant here.
