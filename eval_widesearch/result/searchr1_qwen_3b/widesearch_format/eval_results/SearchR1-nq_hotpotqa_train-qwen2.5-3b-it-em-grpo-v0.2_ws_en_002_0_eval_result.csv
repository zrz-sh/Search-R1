bacardi,Bacardi,,,añejocuatro,Bacardi Silver,0.0,"Let's analyze the given pair step by step according to the grading criterion:

- Criterion: ""It is sufficient if the semantics are approximately the same as the reference answer or if they point to the same entity. There is no need for a word-for-word correspondence.""
  
- Standard answer (target): ""40.0%""
- Response: ""37.5%""

Analysis:

- Both responses are percentage values but the numerical values differ.
- The response ""37.5%"" is close but not semantically equivalent to ""40.0%"".
- Since the values represent different entities (percentages), they do not point to the same entity.
- The criterion requires approximately the same semantics or pointing to the same entity.
- Approximately the same implies a small margin of error would be acceptable, but here ""37.5%"" vs ""40.0%"" has a difference of 2.5%, which can be considered not close enough since the question needs strict correctness (only 0 or 1 scores).
- Without knowledge on acceptable tolerance, conservatively this is not equivalent.

Final judgment: Score = 0

```json
{
    ""idx_0"": 0
}
```",40.0%,37.5%,1.0,key_match,1.0,"Analysis:

- The standard answer (target) for idx_0 is ""rum"".
- The response for idx_0 is also ""rum"".
- According to the criterion, if the semantics are approximately the same or point to the same entity, it is sufficient.
- Here, the response exactly matches the standard answer.
- Therefore, the score should be 1.

Final scoring result:

```json
{
    ""idx_0"": 1
}
```",rum,rum,1.0,"Let's analyze the provided pair according to the grading criteria:

- Standard answer (target): ""750ml""
- Response: ""70cl""

Step-by-step analysis:

1. Semantics/Entity check: Both are measurements of wine bottle capacity.

2. Quantity/comparison: 
   - 750ml is equivalent to 75cl (since 1cl = 10ml).
   - Response says ""70cl"", which is close to ""75cl"" but not exactly the same.

3. According to the criteria:
   - Different regions have wines of different specifications, so the capacity does not need to be exactly the same.
   - It is sufficient if the semantics are approximately the same or if they point to the same entity.

Since 70cl and 75cl are similar quantities (only 5cl difference), and both refer to wine bottle capacity, this should be acceptable.

Therefore, the response meets the criterion.

Final score: 1

    ""idx_0"": 1

```",750ml,70cl,1.0,key_match,0.0,"Let's analyze the pair step by step:

- Reference answer (target): ""darkrum""
- Response: ""corerange""

Evaluation according to the criterion:

- The response should have the same or approximately the same semantics as the reference answer or at least point to the same entity.
- ""corerange"" is unrelated to ""darkrum"" in meaning or entity. It does not refer to the same type of item, category, or a related concept.
- There is no semantic or referential overlap.

Therefore, the response is incorrect.
