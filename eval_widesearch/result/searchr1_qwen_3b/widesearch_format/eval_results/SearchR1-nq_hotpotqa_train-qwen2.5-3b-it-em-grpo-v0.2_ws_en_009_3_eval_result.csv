---

### Pair idx_0:

- **Target answer:**  
  ```
  culturalstudiesandcapitalism
  30credits
  doingculturalstudies
  30credits
  maculturalstudiesdissertation(methodologyandresearch)
  60credits
  ```
  
  The target mentions three specific course/module names and their corresponding credits.

- **Response:**  
  ```
  criticalthinking,researchmethods,culturalanalysis
  ```
  
  The response lists three modules, none of which matches or even approximately corresponds to the entities in the target answer.  
  - The target lists ""culturalstudiesandcapitalism,"" ""doingculturalstudies,"" and a dissertation (""maculturalstudiesdissertation(methodologyandresearch)"") — all oriented toward cultural studies modules with credit values.
  - The response lists ""criticalthinking,"" ""researchmethods,"" ""culturalanalysis"" — these look like different modules and do not semantically represent or point to the same entities as the target answers.
  
- **Judgment:**  
  According to the criterion, the semantics need to be approximately the same or point to the same entities. The response fails to meet this standard.

- **Score:** 0

---

### Pair idx_1:

- **Target answer:**

  ```
  introductiontomediaandcommunicationstheory
  30credits
  dissertation
  60credits
  ```

- **Response:**  
  ```
  communication,mediatheory,culturalstudies,digitalculture
  ```
  
  - The target answers specify ""introduction to media and communications theory"" and ""dissertation.""
  - The response includes ""communication"" and ""mediatheory,"" which approximate ""introductiontomediaandcommunicationstheory.""
  - It also mentions ""culturalstudies"" and ""digitalculture,"" which are related fields but not mentioned in the target.
  - The dissertation is missing in the response, but the criteria specify that missing corresponding scores (credits) are acceptable.

- **Judgment:**  
  Since the response includes modules that approximately capture the essence of the first target module (""communication,"" ""mediatheory"" → ""introductiontomediaandcommunicationstheory""), and missing the dissertation module can be accepted as per criteria, the response is acceptable.

- **Score:** 1

- Criterion:  
  - Semantics should be approximately the same as the reference answer or point to the same entity.  
  - No need for exact word-for-word match.  
  - Outputting the calculated score (e.g., ""60"" for ""30 + 30"") is acceptable.

### Pair idx_0
- Target: ""30+30+60""  
- Response: ""/""  

Analysis:  
- Response is just ""/"", which is not semantically related to the target expression ""30+30+60"".  
- It does not point to the same entity or content and is meaningless in context.

### For idx_0:

- **Target:** ""6.5 with a 6.5 in writing and no element lower than 6.0""
- **Response:** ""overall: 7.0, band 7.5 for each component""

**Analysis:**

- The target states an overall band of 6.5, with 6.5 in writing, and all components no lower than 6.0.
- The response states an overall band 7.0, band 7.5 for each component.
- These do not point to the same score or entity; the numbers differ significantly.
- Semantics are not approximately the same; they are different scores.
- Therefore, the response is not correct compared to the target.

**Score:** 0

### For idx_1:

- **Target:** Same as idx_0
- **Response:** Same as idx_0

**Analysis:**

- Same analysis as idx_0 applies here.

- It is enough if they point to the same entity (no exact wording required).

### idx_0
- Target: ""1yearfull-time""  
- Response: ""notexplicit""  

Analysis:  
- ""notexplicit"" does not indicate any time duration or format.  
- The response does not match or even approximate the meaning of ""1yearfull-time"".  
- No semantic similarity with the target.  
- Score: 0

### idx_1
- Target: ""1yearfull-time""  
- Response: ""1year""  

Analysis:  
- ""1year"" captures the duration (1 year) but omits ""full-time"".  
- But the criterion states approximate semantics or pointing to the same entity is sufficient.  
- Since ""1year"" at least indicates the duration correctly and is close enough for the purpose, it may be considered acceptable.  
- The difference is minor and may be tolerated under ""approximate semantics.""
