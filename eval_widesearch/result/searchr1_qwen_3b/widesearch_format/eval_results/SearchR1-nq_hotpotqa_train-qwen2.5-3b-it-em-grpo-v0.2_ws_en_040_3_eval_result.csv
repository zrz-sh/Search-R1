Analysis: ""social networking"" and ""social media"" are closely related concepts. Social networking is a subset or feature of social media.

Analysis: ""Messaging"" is a form of ""communication,"" but ""communication"" is broader. The criterion requires approximate semantics or pointing to the same entity. ""Communication"" is a broader term, so responding with this might be acceptable if the intent was messaging.

**idx_0:**  
Response: ""socialnetworking""  
Target: ""socialmedia""  
Analysis: ""social networking"" and ""social media"" are closely related concepts. Social networking is a subset or feature of social media.

""Communication"" is a broader term, so responding with this might be acceptable if the intent was messaging. However, the response is more general and not specifically the same entity as ""messaging.""
