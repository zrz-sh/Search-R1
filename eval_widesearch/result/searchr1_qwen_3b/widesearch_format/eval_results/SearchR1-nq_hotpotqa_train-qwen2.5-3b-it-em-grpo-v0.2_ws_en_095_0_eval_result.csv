- Criterion: The response should convey approximately the same semantics as the reference answer (target) or point to the same entity. Word-for-word match is not necessary.

Here are the pairs to analyze:

1. idx_0:  
   - response: '/'  
   - target: '/'  
   Since both response and target are exactly the same symbol '/', they convey the same entity and semantics.  
   Score: 1
