  - Analysis: The target is ""northerncaliforniafirestorm,"" which refers generally to a firestorm in Northern California. The response ""thomasfire"" refers to a specific fire event named the Thomas Fire, which actually occurred in Southern California. Since the criterion says the semantics should be approximately the same or point to the same entity, ""thomasfire"" is not the same as ""northerncaliforniafirestorm"" — these are different fires in different regions.
