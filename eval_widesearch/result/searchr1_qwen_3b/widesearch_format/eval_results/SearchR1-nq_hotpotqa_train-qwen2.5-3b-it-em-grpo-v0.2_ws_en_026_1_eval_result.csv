- Response: ""kyrstensinema(d)&joshhawley(r)""
- Target: ""kyrstensinema(i)markkelly(d)""
- Sinema is indicated (D) vs (I) - substitution allowed between D and I for Joe Manchin only? Criterion says yes only for Joe Manchin (D) and (I) - no generalization to others.
- So Sinema (d) vs Sinema (i) - is that accepted? Criterion does not say so explicitly.
- Since it says only for Joe Manchin, we cannot treat (d) vs (i) as equivalent here.
- Josh Hawley vs Mark Kelly - entirely different senators.
- Response includes Sinema (d), target Sinema (i), and Mark Kelly (d).
- Because of (d) vs (i) for Sinema is probably not accepted, and second senator differs.

- Sinema is indicated (D) vs (I) - substitution allowed between D and I for Joe Manchin only? Criterion says yes only for Joe Manchin (D) and (I) - no generalization to others.
- So Sinema (d) vs Sinema (i) - is that accepted? Criterion does not say so explicitly.
- Since it says only for Joe Manchin, we cannot treat (d) vs (i) as equivalent here.
- Josh Hawley vs Mark Kelly - entirely different senators.
- Response includes Sinema (d), target Sinema (i), and Mark Kelly (d).
- Because of (d) vs (i) for Sinema is probably not accepted, and second senator differs.

- Sinema is indicated (D) vs (I) - substitution allowed between D and I for Joe Manchin only? Criterion says yes only for Joe Manchin (D) and (I) - no generalization to others.
- So Sinema (d) vs Sinema (i) - is that accepted? Criterion does not say so explicitly.
- Since it says only for Joe Manchin, we cannot treat (d) vs (i) as equivalent here.
- Josh Hawley vs Mark Kelly - entirely different senators.
- Response includes Sinema (d), target Sinema (i), and Mark Kelly (d).
- Because of (d) vs (i) for Sinema is probably not accepted, and second senator differs.

- Target: ""kyrstensinema(i)markkelly(d)""
- Sinema is indicated (D) vs (I) - substitution allowed between D and I for Joe Manchin only? Criterion says yes only for Joe Manchin (D) and (I) - no generalization to others.
- So Sinema (d) vs Sinema (i) - is that accepted? Criterion does not say so explicitly.
- Since it says only for Joe Manchin, we cannot treat (d) vs (i) as equivalent here.
- Josh Hawley vs Mark Kelly - entirely different senators.
- Response includes Sinema (d), target Sinema (i), and Mark Kelly (d).
- Because of (d) vs (i) for Sinema is probably not accepted, and second senator differs.

- Criterion: It is sufficient if semantics are approximately the same or point to the same entity. No strict word-for-word needed.
- Also, substitutions like Joe Manchin (D) and Joe Manchin (I) accepted, but this applies only if relevant.

---

### idx_0
- Response: ""willainsworth(r)&richardshelby(r)""
- Target: ""tommytuberville(r)katiebritt(r)""
- Response senators: Will Ainsworth (likely AL Lt. Governor, not a senator) & Richard Shelby (Retiring Senator AL)
- Target senators: Tommy Tuberville (AL Senator) & Katie Britt (New AL Senator, replacing Shelby)
- The response names do not match or approximate target senators. Also, Will Ainsworth is not a senator.
- Score: 0

### idx_1
- Response: ""lisamurkowski(r)&dansullivan(r)""
- Target: ""lisamurkowski(r)dansullivan(r)""
- Exact same two senators, minor difference: & vs just concatenated; semantically the same.
- Score: 1

### idx_2
- Response: ""kyrstensinema(d)&joshhawley(r)""
- Target: ""kyrstensinema(i)markkelly(d)""
- Sinema is indicated (D) vs (I) - substitution allowed between D and I for Joe Manchin only? Criterion says yes only for Joe Manchin (D) and (I) - no generalization to others.
- So Sinema (d) vs Sinema (i) - is that accepted? Criterion does not say so explicitly.
- Since it says only for Joe Manchin, we cannot treat (d) vs (i) as equivalent here.
- Josh Hawley vs Mark Kelly - entirely different senators.
- Response includes Sinema (d), target Sinema (i), and Mark Kelly (d).
- Because of (d) vs (i) for Sinema is probably not accepted, and second senator differs.
- Score: 0

### idx_3
- Response: ""johnboozman(r)&tomcotton(r)""
- Target: ""johnboozman(r)tomcotton(r)""
- Same two senators, different formatting but semantically equivalent.
- Score: 1

### idx_4
- Response: ""jerrybrown(d)&alexpadilla(d)""
- Target: ""alexpadilla(d)laphonzabutler(d)""
- Response is Jerry Brown and Alex Padilla; target is Alex Padilla and LaPhonza Butler.
- Jerry Brown is not a senator.
- Only overlap is Alex Padilla.
- One senator matches, other does not.
- Criterion requires approximate semantics or pointing to same entity. Partial overlap is not enough to get full score.
- According to instructions, score is 0 or 1 only.
- Since partially correct is not specified as accepted, partial is likely 0.
- Score: 0

### idx_5
- Response: ""michaelbennet(d)&johnthune(r)""
- Target: ""michaelbennet(d)johnhickenlooper(d)""
- One senator matches (Bennet), other is different (John Thune vs John Hickenlooper).
- As above, partial matches are not accepted to grant full score.
- Score: 0

### idx_6
- Response: ""richardblumenthal(d)&chrismurphy(d)""
- Target: ""richardblumenthal(d)chrismurphy(d)""
- Exact match except format. Score: 1

- Response: contains some URLs and ""chrismurphy(d)&johnthune(r)""
