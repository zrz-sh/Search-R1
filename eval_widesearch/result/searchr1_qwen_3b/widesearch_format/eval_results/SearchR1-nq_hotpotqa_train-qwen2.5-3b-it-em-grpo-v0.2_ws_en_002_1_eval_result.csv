- Response: ""40""  
- Target: ""40.0%""  
Analysis:  
The response ""40"" numerically matches ""40"" in ""40.0%"". The target includes a percentage sign and a decimal, but the numeric value is essentially the same. Since the criterion says semantics approximately the same or pointing to the same entity is sufficient, ""40"" matches ""40.0%"".
