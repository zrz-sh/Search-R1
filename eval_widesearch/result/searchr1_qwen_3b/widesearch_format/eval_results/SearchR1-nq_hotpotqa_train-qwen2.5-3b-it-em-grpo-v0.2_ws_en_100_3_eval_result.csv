```",donaldtrump,"biden,joe",1.0,key_match,0.0,"Let's analyze each pair according to the criterion:

Criterion says:  
- The response is sufficient if the semantics are approximately the same or point to the same entity.  
- No need for word-for-word match.  

Given that the response and target are single words naming political parties (""republican"" or ""democratic""), semantics depend on whether they name the same party.
