**idx_1**

""Socialmedia"" and ""messaging"" are related but not the same entity. Messaging is a specific communication function, social media is a broader category. They are not interchangeable here. So semantics are not approximately the same. → score = 0

Messaging is a subset or feature of social media, but here the target is ""socialmedia"", a broader category. The response restricts to messaging only, so not fully the same entity. According to criterion, approximate same entity needed. Messaging is narrower, not equal. → score = 0

**idx_4**

**idx_0**

Same exact term → score = 1

**idx_1**  
Response: ""socialmedia""  
Target: ""messaging""  
""Socialmedia"" and ""messaging"" are related but not the same entity. Messaging is a specific communication function, social media is a broader category. They are not interchangeable here. So semantics are not approximately the same. → score = 0

Exact same → score = 1

**idx_3**

Target: ""socialmedia""  
Messaging is a subset or feature of social media, but here the target is ""socialmedia"", a broader category. The response restricts to messaging only, so not fully the same entity. According to criterion, approximate same entity needed. Messaging is narrower, not equal. → score = 0

**idx_4**

**idx_0**

Target: ""socialmedia""  
Same exact term → score = 1

**idx_1**  
Response: ""socialmedia""  
Target: ""messaging""  
""Socialmedia"" and ""messaging"" are related but not the same entity. Messaging is a specific communication function, social media is a broader category. They are not interchangeable here. So semantics are not approximately the same. → score = 0

Exact same → score = 1

**idx_3**  
Response: ""messaging""  
Target: ""socialmedia""  
Messaging is a subset or feature of social media, but here the target is ""socialmedia"", a broader category. The response restricts to messaging only, so not fully the same entity. According to criterion, approximate same entity needed. Messaging is narrower, not equal. → score = 0

**idx_4**

""Videostreaming"" is mostly entertainment or content delivery; ""communication"" is a broader concept of interaction. They do not point to the same entity or approximate meaning. → score = 0

""Videocalls"" is a feature/function within communication/social media apps but is not the same as social media itself. The target is the broader platform category, the response is a sub-function. Per criterion approximate same entity points are needed. I judge these as not similar enough here → score = 0

""Music"" is entertainment. ""Messaging"" is communication. Different entities → score = 0

Same exact term → score = 1

**idx_1**  
Response: ""socialmedia""  
Target: ""messaging""  
""Socialmedia"" and ""messaging"" are related but not the same entity. Messaging is a specific communication function, social media is a broader category. They are not interchangeable here. So semantics are not approximately the same. → score = 0

**idx_2**  
Response: ""socialmedia""  
Target: ""socialmedia""  
Exact same → score = 1

**idx_3**  
Response: ""messaging""  
Target: ""socialmedia""  
Messaging is a subset or feature of social media, but here the target is ""socialmedia"", a broader category. The response restricts to messaging only, so not fully the same entity. According to criterion, approximate same entity needed. Messaging is narrower, not equal. → score = 0

**idx_4**  
Response: ""videostreaming""  
Target: ""communication""  
""Videostreaming"" is mostly entertainment or content delivery; ""communication"" is a broader concept of interaction. They do not point to the same entity or approximate meaning. → score = 0

**idx_5**  
Response: ""shopping""  
Target: ""messaging""  
""Shopping"" is e-commerce, ""messaging"" is communication. Different entities. → score = 0

**idx_6**  
Response: ""videocalls""  
Target: ""socialmedia""  
""Videocalls"" is a feature/function within communication/social media apps but is not the same as social media itself. The target is the broader platform category, the response is a sub-function. Per criterion approximate same entity points are needed. I judge these as not similar enough here → score = 0

**idx_7**  
Response: ""music""  
Target: ""messaging""  
""Music"" is entertainment. ""Messaging"" is communication. Different entities → score = 0

**idx_8**  
Response: ""e-commerce""  
Target: ""communication""  
E-commerce is shopping category, communication is different. → score = 0

**idx_9**  
Response: ""streaming""  
Target: ""entertainment""  
""Streaming"" here likely refers to video or audio streaming, which is a form of entertainment. These are approximately the same in semantics. → score = 1
