,,t1,T1,0.0,"Let's analyze each pair according to the criterion:

Criterion: ""It is sufficient if the semantics are approximately the same as the reference answer or if they point to the same entity. There is no need for a word-for-word correspondence.""

---

- idx_0: response = ""central""; target = ""northshore&westernlines""

  The target mentions two lines: northshore & western lines. The response is ""central"".

  Are ""central"" and ""northshore & westernlines"" semantically approximately the same or do they point to the same entity?

  - ""central"" likely refers to Central station or Central line, which is a different entity than northshore or western lines.

  Conclusion: No match. Score = 0.

---

- idx_1: response = ""western""; target = ""leppington&innerwestline""

  Target is ""leppington&innerwestline"" (two lines).

  Response is ""western"".

  The response ""western"" could map to the ""innerwestline"" (inner west line), so roughly yes, ""western"" aligns semantically with ""innerwestline"" portion.

  Since it's sufficient to be approximately the same or point to the same entity, ""western"" seems to refer to the line ""innerwestline"".

  ""leppington"" line is another one; the response ignored it.

  But the target is two lines, the response only one.

  The criterion does not require full coverage but approximate equivalency or pointing to the same entity.

  Since a partial match to one of the two target lines is present, this should be considered acceptable.

  Score = 1.

---

- idx_2: response = ""airport""; target = ""liverpool&innerwestline""

  Target: ""liverpool&innerwestline""

  Response: ""airport""

  Is ""airport"" approximately semantically the same or point to same entity as ""liverpool&innerwestline""?

  Liverpool, inner west line and airport line are different lines/entities.

  No direct overlap.

  Score = 0.

---

- idx_3: response = ""eastern""; target = ""easternsuburbs&illawarraline""

  Target: ""easternsuburbs&illawarraline""

  Response: ""eastern""

  ""Eastern"" can be seen as short for ""eastern suburbs"" line.

  Points to same entity approximately.

  The other line ""illawarraline"" is absent in response.

  Partial coverage is acceptable.

  Score = 1.

---

- idx_4: response = ""airportcentral""; target = ""cumberlandline""

  Target is ""cumberlandline""

  Response is ""airportcentral""

  No semantic approximation, they refer to different lines.

  So no match.

  Score = 0.

---

- idx_5: response = ""northshore""; target = ""lidcombe&bankstownline""

  Target: ""lidcombe&bankstownline""

  Response: ""northshore""

  Northshore line is different from lidcombe or bankstown line.

  No overlap.

  Score = 0.

---

- idx_6: response = ""parramatta""; target = ""olympicparkline""

  Response: ""parramatta""

  Target: ""olympicparkline""

  Parramatta is a station, Olympic Park line is a line.

  They are not semantically the same or pointing to the same entity (station vs line).

  Score = 0.

---

- idx_7: response = ""cityloop""; target = ""airport&southline""

  Target: ""airport&southline""

  Response: ""cityloop""

  City loop is a known train loop line, different from the airport line or southline.

  No semantic overlap.

  Score = 0.

Criterion: ""It is sufficient if the semantics are approximately the same as the reference answer or if they point to the same entity. There is no need for a word-for-word correspondence.""

---

- idx_0: response = ""central""; target = ""northshore&westernlines""

  The target mentions two lines: northshore & western lines. The response is ""central"".

  Are ""central"" and ""northshore & westernlines"" semantically approximately the same or do they point to the same entity?

  - ""central"" likely refers to Central station or Central line, which is a different entity than northshore or western lines.

  Conclusion: No match. Score = 0.

---

- idx_1: response = ""western""; target = ""leppington&innerwestline""

  Target is ""leppington&innerwestline"" (two lines).

  Response is ""western"".

  The response ""western"" could map to the ""innerwestline"" (inner west line), so roughly yes, ""western"" aligns semantically with ""innerwestline"" portion.

  Since it's sufficient to be approximately the same or point to the same entity, ""western"" seems to refer to the line ""innerwestline"".

  ""leppington"" line is another one; the response ignored it.

  But the target is two lines, the response only one.

  The criterion does not require full coverage but approximate equivalency or pointing to the same entity.

  Since a partial match to one of the two target lines is present, this should be considered acceptable.

  Score = 1.

---

- idx_2: response = ""airport""; target = ""liverpool&innerwestline""

  Target: ""liverpool&innerwestline""

  Response: ""airport""

  Is ""airport"" approximately semantically the same or point to same entity as ""liverpool&innerwestline""?

  Liverpool, inner west line and airport line are different lines/entities.

  No direct overlap.

  Score = 0.

---

- idx_3: response = ""eastern""; target = ""easternsuburbs&illawarraline""

  Target: ""easternsuburbs&illawarraline""

  Response: ""eastern""

  ""Eastern"" can be seen as short for ""eastern suburbs"" line.

  Points to same entity approximately.

  The other line ""illawarraline"" is absent in response.

  Partial coverage is acceptable.

  Score = 1.

---

- idx_4: response = ""airportcentral""; target = ""cumberlandline""

  Target is ""cumberlandline""

  Response is ""airportcentral""

  No semantic approximation, they refer to different lines.

  So no match.

  Score = 0.

---

- idx_5: response = ""northshore""; target = ""lidcombe&bankstownline""

  Target: ""lidcombe&bankstownline""

  Response: ""northshore""

  Northshore line is different from lidcombe or bankstown line.

  No overlap.

  Score = 0.

---

- idx_6: response = ""parramatta""; target = ""olympicparkline""

  Response: ""parramatta""

  Target: ""olympicparkline""

  Parramatta is a station, Olympic Park line is a line.

  They are not semantically the same or pointing to the same entity (station vs line).

  Score = 0.

---

- idx_7: response = ""cityloop""; target = ""airport&southline""

  Target: ""airport&southline""

  Response: ""cityloop""

  City loop is a known train loop line, different from the airport line or southline.

  No semantic overlap.

  Score = 0.

---

- idx_8: response = ""cumberland""; target = ""northernline""

  Target: ""northernline""

,,t8,T8,0.0,"Let's analyze each pair according to the criterion:

Criterion: ""It is sufficient if the semantics are approximately the same as the reference answer or if they point to the same entity. There is no need for a word-for-word correspondence.""

---

- idx_0: response = ""central""; target = ""northshore&westernlines""

  The target mentions two lines: northshore & western lines. The response is ""central"".

  Are ""central"" and ""northshore & westernlines"" semantically approximately the same or do they point to the same entity?

  - ""central"" likely refers to Central station or Central line, which is a different entity than northshore or western lines.

  Conclusion: No match. Score = 0.

---

- idx_1: response = ""western""; target = ""leppington&innerwestline""

  Target is ""leppington&innerwestline"" (two lines).

  Response is ""western"".

  The response ""western"" could map to the ""innerwestline"" (inner west line), so roughly yes, ""western"" aligns semantically with ""innerwestline"" portion.

  Since it's sufficient to be approximately the same or point to the same entity, ""western"" seems to refer to the line ""innerwestline"".

  ""leppington"" line is another one; the response ignored it.

  But the target is two lines, the response only one.

  The criterion does not require full coverage but approximate equivalency or pointing to the same entity.

  Since a partial match to one of the two target lines is present, this should be considered acceptable.

  Score = 1.

---

- idx_2: response = ""airport""; target = ""liverpool&innerwestline""

  Target: ""liverpool&innerwestline""

  Response: ""airport""

  Is ""airport"" approximately semantically the same or point to same entity as ""liverpool&innerwestline""?

  Liverpool, inner west line and airport line are different lines/entities.

  No direct overlap.

  Score = 0.

---

- idx_3: response = ""eastern""; target = ""easternsuburbs&illawarraline""

  Target: ""easternsuburbs&illawarraline""

  Response: ""eastern""

  ""Eastern"" can be seen as short for ""eastern suburbs"" line.

  Points to same entity approximately.

  The other line ""illawarraline"" is absent in response.

  Partial coverage is acceptable.

  Score = 1.

---

- idx_4: response = ""airportcentral""; target = ""cumberlandline""

  Target is ""cumberlandline""

  Response is ""airportcentral""

  No semantic approximation, they refer to different lines.

  So no match.

  Score = 0.

---

- idx_5: response = ""northshore""; target = ""lidcombe&bankstownline""

  Target: ""lidcombe&bankstownline""

  Response: ""northshore""

  Northshore line is different from lidcombe or bankstown line.

  No overlap.

  Score = 0.

---

- idx_6: response = ""parramatta""; target = ""olympicparkline""

  Response: ""parramatta""

  Target: ""olympicparkline""

  Parramatta is a station, Olympic Park line is a line.

  They are not semantically the same or pointing to the same entity (station vs line).

  Score = 0.

---

- idx_7: response = ""cityloop""; target = ""airport&southline""

  Target: ""airport&southline""

  Response: ""cityloop""

  City loop is a known train loop line, different from the airport line or southline.

  No semantic overlap.

  Score = 0.

---

- idx_8: response = ""cumberland""; target = ""northernline""

  Target: ""northernline""

  Response: ""cumberland""

  Cumberland is a line different from northern line.

  No semantic approximation.

  Score = 0.
