Criterion: It is sufficient if the semantics are approximately the same as the reference answer or if they point to the same entity.

Details:
- Since the target is a company or brand name (e.g., e-trade, at&twireless, pepsi, bridgestone, applemusic), and the response is a pair of artists, it appears the question expects naming artists or musical acts associated with that target (probably celebrity endorsers or campaign artists linked to the brand).

- For each pair, we check if the response names artists linked to the target (brand) or at least semantically relevant to it.

To do this, I will use my knowledge of advertising partners, sponsorships, or brand ambassadors.
