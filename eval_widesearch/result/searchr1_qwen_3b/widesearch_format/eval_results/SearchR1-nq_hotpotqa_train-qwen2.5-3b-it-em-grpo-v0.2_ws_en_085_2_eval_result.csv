,,joker,Joker,1.0,"Let's analyze the given pair according to the criterion provided.

**Given:**

- idx_0
- Response: ""unitedstates""
- Target (standard answer): ""usa/canada""

**Criterion:**

- Semantics approximately the same or pointing to the same entity is sufficient.
- Word-for-word correspondence not needed.
- Content to be evaluated only needs to be a subset of the reference answer.

**Step-by-step analysis:**

- The target answer includes ""usa/canada"".
- The response is ""unitedstates"".
- ""United States"" is equivalent to ""USA"".
- So the response matches one part of the standard answer set.
- Since the criterion says ""content only needs to be a subset of the reference answer"", and ""unitedstates"" is semantically the same as ""usa"", this is sufficient to be considered correct.

**Conclusion:**

- Score: 1

```",usa/canada,unitedstates,1.0,"Let's analyze the provided pair according to the criterion.

- Reference answer (target): ""toddphillips""
- Response: ""toddphillips""
- Criterion: semantics approximately the same or point to the same entity is sufficient; no need for word-for-word correspondence.

Analysis:
- Both the response and the target are exactly the same string ""toddphillips"".
- The semantics fully match.
- Hence, this response is completely correct and should receive full score.

Final score: 1

```json
{
    ""idx_0"": 1
}
```",toddphillips,toddphillips,1.0,"Step-by-step analysis:

- Reference answer (target) is ""drama/thriller/crime"". This means the reference answer contains three genre categories.
- Response is ""drama"".
- According to the criterion, ""It is sufficient if the semantics are approximately the same as the reference answer or if they point to the same entity."" Here, ""drama"" is one part of the multi-genre reference answer.
- The content to be evaluated only needs to be relevant to the reference answer, and inclusions or exclusions of parts of the categories are accepted.
- Response ""drama"" matches one of the categories in the target ""drama/thriller/crime"".
- There is no requirement that all parts of the multi-label reference must be covered.
- Therefore, the response is relevant and pointing to the same entity as part of the reference answer.
- Hence, the score according to the criterion is 1.

Final scoring result:

```json
{
  ""idx_0"": 1
}
```",drama/thriller/crime,drama,1.0,"Let's analyze the given pair according to the criterion:

- Standard answer (target): ""118min""
- Response: ""120min""

Criterion: It is sufficient if the semantics are approximately the same or if they point to the same entity. No need for word-for-word correspondence.

Analysis: Both answers represent a duration of time in minutes. 118 minutes and 120 minutes are very close in meaning and effectively indicate the same approximate amount of time. Since the criterion allows semantic approximation, the response satisfies the requirement.

Score: 1 (completely correct)
