**idx_0:**

Target: ""anglesey""  
Exact match → score = 1

---

**idx_2:**  
Response: ""herefordshire,gloucestershire""  
Target: ""monmouthshireengland:gloucestershire,herefordshire""  
- The target includes ""monmouthshireengland:"" prefix, which looks like formatting noise. The main entities are ""gloucestershire"" & ""herefordshire"" plus monmouthshire.  
- The response has ""herefordshire, gloucestershire""  
- Although missing ""monmouthshire"", the response points to two of the main counties also in the target. The criterion allows approximate semantics or pointing to the same entities. Since monmouthshire is an extra entity in the target (not in response), and response entities are in the target, this is acceptable.  
→ score = 1

---

**idx_3:**  
Response: ""countyantrim""  
Target: ""antrim""  
- ""countyantrim"" seems like ""county antrim"" mashed together. This is the same geographical entity ""Antrim"".  
- The criterion allows approximate semantics. So, this can be considered correct.  
→ score = 1

---

**idx_4:**  
Response: ""highland,perthandkinross""  
Target: ""highland,argyllandbute,\nperthandkinross""  
- The response includes ""highland"" and ""perthandkinross""  
- The target includes those plus ""argyllandbute""  
- Missing ""argyllandbute"" in response, but the response covers majority and the target’s extra entity is acceptable under approximate semantics? Possibly. The criterion is lenient.  
→ score = 1

---

**idx_5:**  
Response: ""highland,moray,aberdeenshire,grampian""  
Target: ""highland,aberdeenshire,\nmoray""  
- Response includes ""highland"", ""moray"", and ""aberdeenshire"" which are in the target.  
- Response adds ""grampian"" which is not in the target. Adding is acceptable unless it's contradictory or changes meaning. Here, it is a related region, so likely acceptable.  
→ score = 1

---

**idx_6:**  
Response: ""sutherland,caithness""  
Target: ""highland""  
- Response is ""sutherland,caithness"" while target is ""highland""  
- Sutherland and Caithness are both regions within the larger Highland council area.  
- The criterion accepts approximate semantics or pointing to the same entity. Sutherland and Caithness are parts of Highland, so it's acceptable.  
→ score = 1

---

**idx_7:**  
Response: ""westerross""  
Target: ""highland""  
- Wester Ross is also a part of Highland region. Again, pointing to the same entity conceptually.

**idx_0:**

Target: ""dorset""  
Exact match, semantics clearly the same → score = 1

**idx_1:**  
Response: ""anglesey""  
Target: ""anglesey""  
Exact match → score = 1

---

**idx_2:**  
Response: ""herefordshire,gloucestershire""  
Target: ""monmouthshireengland:gloucestershire,herefordshire""  
- The target includes ""monmouthshireengland:"" prefix, which looks like formatting noise. The main entities are ""gloucestershire"" & ""herefordshire"" plus monmouthshire.  
- The response has ""herefordshire, gloucestershire""  
- Although missing ""monmouthshire"", the response points to two of the main counties also in the target. The criterion allows approximate semantics or pointing to the same entities. Since monmouthshire is an extra entity in the target (not in response), and response entities are in the target, this is acceptable.  
→ score = 1

---

**idx_3:**  
Response: ""countyantrim""  
Target: ""antrim""  
- ""countyantrim"" seems like ""county antrim"" mashed together. This is the same geographical entity ""Antrim"".  
- The criterion allows approximate semantics. So, this can be considered correct.  
→ score = 1

**idx_4:**

Target: ""highland,argyllandbute,\nperthandkinross""  
- The response includes ""highland"" and ""perthandkinross""

- Missing ""argyllandbute"" in response, but the response covers majority and the target’s extra entity is acceptable under approximate semantics? Possibly. The criterion is lenient.  
→ score = 1

---

**idx_5:**  
Response: ""highland,moray,aberdeenshire,grampian""  
Target: ""highland,aberdeenshire,\nmoray""  
- Response includes ""highland"", ""moray"", and ""aberdeenshire"" which are in the target.  
- Response adds ""grampian"" which is not in the target. Adding is acceptable unless it's contradictory or changes meaning. Here, it is a related region, so likely acceptable.  
→ score = 1

---

**idx_6:**  
Response: ""sutherland,caithness""  
Target: ""highland""  
- Response is ""sutherland,caithness"" while target is ""highland""  
- Sutherland and Caithness are both regions within the larger Highland council area.  
- The criterion accepts approximate semantics or pointing to the same entity. Sutherland and Caithness are parts of Highland, so it's acceptable.  
→ score = 1

---

**idx_7:**  
Response: ""westerross""  
Target: ""highland""  
- Wester Ross is also a part of Highland region. Again, pointing to the same entity conceptually.

**idx_2:**  
Response: ""herefordshire,gloucestershire""  
Target: ""monmouthshireengland:gloucestershire,herefordshire""  
- The target includes ""monmouthshireengland:"" prefix, which looks like formatting noise. The main entities are ""gloucestershire"" & ""herefordshire"" plus monmouthshire.  
- The response has ""herefordshire, gloucestershire""  
- Although missing ""monmouthshire"", the response points to two of the main counties also in the target. The criterion allows approximate semantics or pointing to the same entities. Since monmouthshire is an extra entity in the target (not in response), and response entities are in the target, this is acceptable.  
→ score = 1

---

**idx_3:**  
Response: ""countyantrim""  
Target: ""antrim""  
- ""countyantrim"" seems like ""county antrim"" mashed together. This is the same geographical entity ""Antrim"".  
- The criterion allows approximate semantics. So, this can be considered correct.

- Missing ""argyllandbute"" in response, but the response covers majority and the target’s extra entity is acceptable under approximate semantics? Possibly. The criterion is lenient.  
→ score = 1

---

**idx_5:**  
Response: ""highland,moray,aberdeenshire,grampian""  
Target: ""highland,aberdeenshire,\nmoray""  
- Response includes ""highland"", ""moray"", and ""aberdeenshire"" which are in the target.  
- Response adds ""grampian"" which is not in the target. Adding is acceptable unless it's contradictory or changes meaning. Here, it is a related region, so likely acceptable.  
→ score = 1

---

**idx_6:**  
Response: ""sutherland,caithness""  
Target: ""highland""  
- Response is ""sutherland,caithness"" while target is ""highland""  
- Sutherland and Caithness are both regions within the larger Highland council area.  
- The criterion accepts approximate semantics or pointing to the same entity. Sutherland and Caithness are parts of Highland, so it's acceptable.  
→ score = 1

---

**idx_7:**

Criterion:  
""It is sufficient if the semantics are approximately the same as the reference answer or if they point to the same entity.""

---

**idx_0**:  
- response: ""naturalengland""  
- target: ""naturalengland""  
- They match exactly. Score = 1

---

**idx_1**:  
- response: ""naturalresourceswales""  
- target: ""naturalresourceswales""  
- Match exactly. Score = 1

---

**idx_2**:  
- response: ""naturalengland""  
- target: ""naturalresourceswales&naturalengland""  
- Target expects both ""naturalresourceswales"" and ""naturalengland"". Response only mentions ""naturalengland"".  
- Lemma: the response matches only part of the target, not the entire. The criterion says ""approximately the same or point to the same entity"" - here the target lists two entities, and only one is provided.  
- Since it's a multi-entity answer, partial mention is technically insufficient to get full credit.  
- So score = 0

**idx_3**:  
- response: ""naturescot""

Criterion summary:  
- Semantics should be approximately the same or point to the same entity.  
- Website links can vary as long as the main body remains the same.

**idx_0**  
- Response: https://www.naturalengland.org.uk/our-work/places-to-visit/aonbs/west-dorset.aspx  
- Target: https://dorset-nl.org.uk/  
Analysis: Both refer to West Dorset AONB, but the response link is from Natural England and the target is a local Dorset-based AONB site. Both refer to the same entity (West Dorset AONB), just different hosting sites. According to the criterion, this is acceptable.  
Score: 1

- Target: https://www.anglesey.gov.wales/en/residents/countryside/areas-of-outstanding-natural-beauty-aonbs/anglesey-area-of-outstanding-natural-beauty-aonb.aspx  
Analysis: Response links to a general site for National Landscapes (umbrella site), target is a specific link about Anglesey AONB. The response does not specifically point to Anglesey AONB but to a general site. The criterion states it is sufficient if semantics are approximately the same or point to the same entity. Here, response is too general relative to target, might be considered missing the specific entity indicated by the target. So the main body/content of the link is different.

**idx_3**  
- Response: https://www.naturescot.net/en/national-scenic-area-antrim-coast-glens/  
- Target: https://antrimcoastandglensaonb.ccght.org/  
Analysis: Both links talk about Antrim Coast & Glens. The response is from NatureScot official site about the national scenic area, and the target is a dedicated website for that AONB. Both refer to the same entity.

**idx_4**  
- Response: https://national-landscapes.org.uk/  
- Target: https://www.nature.scot/professional-advice/protected-areas-and-species/protected-areas/national-designations/national-scenic-areas  
Analysis: Response is the general national-landscapes.org.uk homepage; target is a specific NatureScot page on national designations (national scenic areas). The response is much more general, not directly addressing national scenic areas as the target does. This is similar to idx_1.  
Score: 0
