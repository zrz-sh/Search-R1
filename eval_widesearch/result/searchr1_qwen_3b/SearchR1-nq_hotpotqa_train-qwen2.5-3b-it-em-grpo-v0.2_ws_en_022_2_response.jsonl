After reasoning, if you find you lack some knowledge, you can call a search engine by <search> query </search> and it will return the top searched results between <information> and </information>. You can search as many times as your want. If you find no further external knowledge needed, you can directly provide the answer inside <answer> and </answer>, without detailed illustrations. For example, <answer> Beijing </answer>. Question: I need a list of the top 10 most-streamed songs globally and top 10 most-streamed songs in the U.S. on Spotify in 2024. The header names should include Category, Song Rank, Song Title, Singer, Language, Songwriter(s), Producer(s), and Release Date.\n\nPlease organize the results in one Markdown table with the following columns:\nCategory,Rank, Title,Singer,Language,Songwriter(s),Producer(s),Release Date.\nNote:\n1.The song rankings need to be sorted in descending order.\n2. Most-streamed songs globally and U.S. most-streamed songs need to be distinguished in the \"Category\" column.\n3. Release date should be written as YYYY/MM/DD\n4. If there is more than one songwriter or producer, separate them by comma.\n\nDon't ask me any questions, just output the results according to the columns without omitting cells arbitrarily. The output format is ```markdown\n{data_content}\n```.?\n"
